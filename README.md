# Tuning Retrieval Augmented Question Answering

In this repo, we will design, run and analyze experiments to determine critical factors that influence the quality of answers in retrieval augmented question answering with large language models.  We will consider the effect of the large language model used, the prompting strategy employed, and the use of domain-specific fine-tuning on the model's performance. The goal is to optimize these factors to achieve the highest proportion of correctly answered questions.
