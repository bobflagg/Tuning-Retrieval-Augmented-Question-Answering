6,"The design codes are generally not followed even by the government departments. This has created an alarming situation where a large number of unsafe building stock is added each year to the already huge number of existing unsafe buildings in hostile climate, fragile environment and tectonically active unstable hilly terrain,"" the document said.  — In its report published in September 2019, the NDMA stated that there was ""no land use policy in the country at national, state and local level for implementation"".  ""The cities of the Himalayas are growing and beginning to turn into mountains of garbage and plastic, untreated sewage, chronic water shortages, unplanned urban growth and even local air pollution because of vehicles. These towns need to be planned, particularly keeping in mind the rush of summer tourists. Many states have experimented from banning plastics to taxing tourists to better respond to these issues. But they need support and new thinking,"" the document said.  — The document highlighted problems related to planning and design of buildings, inadequate infrastructure, improper housing/building stock having insufficient strength, unprecedented cutting of vegetation and slopes etc. in hill towns. It flagged how building regulations were copied from the Delhi Master Plan.  — According to the document, while municipal bylaws must provide for construction activity to be regulated in areas which fall in hazard zones, in many cases these provisions have not been strictly enforced. It said the State Municipal Acts in all the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) and Western Ghats (WG) states are more focused on other issues than landslide problems.  — The report said cutting costs was among the reasons for vulnerable buildings. ""In the hills, it's imperative to build on pillars that rest on rock strata. People raise pillars for buildings which are embedded in loose soil because the cost of construction goes up substantially if deeper pillars are to be made."". — The 2019 report had made certain recommendations with regard to such vulnerabilities. ""Where cutting of hill slope in an area causes ecological damage and slope instability in adjacent areas, such cuttings shall not be undertaken unless appropriate measures are taken.","What are some of the key issues and vulnerabilities identified in hill towns in the Himalayas, according to the report?","According to the report, some of the key issues and vulnerabilities identified in hill towns in the Himalayas include:

1. Non-compliance with design codes and building regulations, leading to the addition of unsafe building stock.
2. Lack of a national, state, and local land use policy for implementation.
3. Growing environmental problems such as the accumulation of garbage and plastic, untreated sewage, chronic water shortages, and air pollution from vehicles.
4. Insufficient infrastructure and improper housing/building stock with insufficient strength.
5. Unprecedented cutting of vegetation and slopes, leading to ecological damage and slope instability.
6. Weak enforcement of construction regulations and municipal bylaws in hazard zones.
7. Cutting costs through the use of shallow pillars embedded in loose soil, instead of building on rock strata.

These vulnerabilities highlight the need for better planning, stricter enforcement of regulations, and support for sustainable practices in the development of hill towns in the Himalayas.",7cf119ead22cf9fb46316aa375e7b09d
6,"Last year, Miami-Dade County appointed the world's first chief heat officer. Washington and Oregon have begun distributing thousands of air conditioning units to vulnerable residents and barred utility companies from cutting power to homes during heat waves. .  Remer said Tampa is still in its ""learning and listening"" phase. Last year, the city was awarded $300,000 by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to develop a guide for understanding and fighting the effects of heat in East Tampa, a predominantly Black neighborhood, where at least a third of children live below the poverty line. .  The project director is Taryn Sabia, an urban designer and associate dean at the University of South Florida who focuses on climate resiliency work, which spans hurricane preparedness, flooding, and, increasingly, extreme heat. .  Planting trees is helpful, Sabia said, but they take time to grow and effort to maintain. Quicker actions could include erecting better shade structures at bus stops or implementing rules for construction to encourage the use of materials that generate less heat in the sun. For example, some cities in the Northeast — including Philadelphia and New York — provide financial incentives for "" green roofs ,"" in which the top of a building is covered with plants. .  Another easy step: painting everything white. Light colors reflect sunlight, while dark colors absorb heat. .  And while Florida codes require homes to have a mechanism to provide heat in the winter, there are no codes requiring landlords to provide air conditioning. .  ""You can no longer be here and not have it,"" Sabia said. .  Tampa could better tailor weather advisories for specific needs and neighborhoods, she said. Heat becomes more dangerous more quickly on upper floors of older apartments, for example, because heat rises. Expanding access to cooling shelters is also key. .  It's the hottest week of the year so far in Tampa, and 75-year-old Benjamin Brown is walking home from the eye doctor, about a 30-minute walk. .","What measures are being taken by cities like Miami, Washington, and Oregon to combat the effects of extreme heat, and what actions can be implemented in Tampa to address this issue?","Cities like Miami, Washington, and Oregon have taken measures to combat the effects of extreme heat.

We are inching closer to a deadline in the government's case against former President Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump's lawyers now have about 22 hours to respond to a legal filing from Special Counsel Jack Smith. He requested a protective order after Trump posted this on social media on Friday.

And if they had -- if these nations had cared about women's football, when say the United States, Sweden, Norway, a few others, China, has started to care about women's football, obviously China is in a different category as a communist nation, but as those nations back in the 90s started to fund it, think of not only how empowering it is for girls and women, but also to have new fans and to sell more jerseys and to have more people playing the game.  That's a business decision, even if you don't want to go with the altruistic way. And these are the mistakes that these men, and it is basically all men, have made now for 30 years.

6,"""While naming things can help raise public awareness, I haven't seen any evidence that examines the extent to which naming extreme events has helped preparedness,"" says Dr Chandni Singh, a lead IPCC author and senior researcher at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements in Bengaluru, adding that whether to name heatwaves is not a conversation she has heard in Asia.  Indeed, there is little research on whether naming extreme weather events helps or not. ""Partly this comes down to the nature of the work, a combination of meteorology, psychology and communication studies,"" says Dr Andrew Charlton-Perez, professor of meteorology at Reading University. ""It can be quite hard to build teams that contain all of this expertise."". Charlton-Perez and colleagues analysed the public's reaction in 2017 to Storm Doris, which was named as part of a pilot scheme by the British and Irish meteorological services, later made into a permanent programme. He says that naming the storm meant ""there was increased public awareness of [it] before it affected people in the UK and particularly during and after it arrived"".  Tinkering with names of heatwaves seems almost like a distraction from the real problems and solutionsDr John Nairn, WMO. A similar study by scientists at the National Observatory of Athens (NOA) also suggests that storm-naming is connected to better awareness, explains Dr Vassiliki Kotroni, the research director at NOA. ""We found that there was a very high acceptance of the storm-naming, and explicitly in those people who have been affected by a named storm."". Why would names have this effect? Some point to our social brains. The neuroscientist Dr Kris De Meyer, director of the Climate Action Unit at University College London, explains that human brains are well suited to thinking about the mental state of others as well as ourselves, a process called mentalising.  De Meyer says this happens in areas of our brain that also operate a powerful memory system (separate from the one we use for raw memorisation) that is tailored to social information, such as names. ""Psychologists have termed this extra memory strength for social information the social encoding advantage,"" he says.",Is there evidence to support the effectiveness of naming extreme weather events in raising public awareness and preparedness?,"There is little research on whether naming extreme weather events helps raise public awareness and preparedness. However, one study by Dr. Andrew Charlton-Perez and colleagues analyzed the public's reaction in 2017 to Storm Doris, which was named as part of a pilot scheme by the British and Irish meteorological services.

Similarly, a study by scientists at the National Observatory of Athens found that there was high acceptance of storm-naming, especially among those who had been affected by a named storm.

6,"I'll talk to three former prosecutors about what to expect. Joining me for insight an analysis are USA Today Washington bureau chief Susan Page, Jonathan Martin of Politico, Lanhee Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution and Kimberly Atkins Stohr, senior opinion writer for The Boston Globe. Welcome to Sunday. It's Meet the Press.  ANNOUNCER:. From NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.  CHUCK TODD:. A good Sunday morning. This week marks the unofficial kickoff of the next phase of the 2024 campaign as at least eight Republicans competing to take on Donald Trump will meet in Milwaukee for the first Republican debate. Trump plans to skip the debate and instead is reportedly counterprogramming in an interview he already taped with former Fox host Tucker Carlson. Of course it used to be that extramarital affairs, campaign trail tears, forgetting a cabinet agency, even a weird scream could end a presidential campaign. Now, Donald Trump has been criminally indicted four times in as many months, and faces 91 felony counts, and so leads the Republican field nationally by nearly 40 points. Yet, outside of former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who is polling at 3% in a new Quinnipiac poll and, to a degree, his former Vice President Mike Pence,Trump's Republican opponents, for the most part, are declining to take him on directly.  [START TAPE]. FMR. GOV. NIKKI HALEY:. We've done over 80 town halls in New Hampshire and Iowa, and Eric, not one of them are asking me about Trump. Not one of them are asking me why I'm running against him or anything else.  VIVEK RAMASWAMY:. I think that these indictments are a disaster for the country. And I say this as somebody who just looked at the polls that have come out in the last 24 hours. I'm holding second in many of these national polls.

Such initiatives can help young urbanites understand how forests are vital to sustain lives across society, and how local communities - located far from cities - play a key role in protecting natural resources, according to Toerris Jaeger, director of the Oslo-based NGO Rainforest Foundation Norway.  ""The fact that Indonesia has managed to reduce the rate of deforestation should give hope to the next generation that yes, it is possible to turn the tide on forest loss,"" he said.  CELEBRITIES AND SHOEMAKER SUPPORT CONSERVATION PROJECT. In 2020, Hutan Itu Indonesia organised a three-day boot camp just outside Jakarta for young people on how to protect forests.  Dwi was one of about 50 young people - including students - to attend the event, where she started work to establish her own green group, ""Forest Is Our Friend"", to boost forest and nature awareness, be it online or at schools, among youths.  Getting involved in several mangrove planting projects, Dwi helped campaign for Hutan Itu Indonesia's new mangrove project on Harapan Island (""Hope Island""), which is part of a string of islands known as Thousand Islands, north of Jakarta.  With no cars, the estimated 200 families who live on Harapan use motorbikes and bicycles to get around its narrow streets, forging a living by providing accommodation, eco-tourism and island-hopping activities for tourists, or by fishing.  Hutan Itu Indonesia's mangrove planting project on Harapan relies on online donations and corporate collaborations, one of which is with shoemaker Cole Haan Indonesia. The company has a scheme of adopting mangroves linked to shoes sold in Indonesia.  Locals help with planting at the project, which was launched in June supported by Indonesian celebrities like actor Marcel Chandrawinata and models the Valerie twins.  Jakarta residents seeking a city break often visit Harapan and the surrounding islands to enjoy nature, see turtles and plant mangroves that contribute to keeping fish stocks high and offer protection against extreme weather and high tides.",What is one way that Hutan Itu Indonesia's mangrove planting project on Harapan Island is funded?,"Hutan Itu Indonesia's mangrove planting project on Harapan Island is funded through online donations and corporate collaborations.

6,"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres signalled Moscow had to tread carefully. ""Any form of co-operation of any country with North Korea must respect the sanctions regime that was imposed by the Security Council,"" Guterres told reporters, adding that it was ""extremely relevant"" in the case of Russia and North Korea. For Russia, the summit was an opportunity to needle the United States, the big power supporter of Ukraine, though it was unclear just how far Putin was prepared to go in fulfilling any North Korean wish lists for technology. Putin said Kim now planned to visit military and civilian aviation factories in the Russian city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur and to inspect Russia's Pacific fleet in Vladivostok. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will visit Pyongyang for more talks next month, the Kremlin said. Putin and Kim called each other ""comrades"" at lunch and Putin repeatedly reminded Kim that it was the Soviet Union that backed North Korea — and was first to recognise it just over 75 years to the day since it was established. Amid the Ukraine war, which has become a grinding artillery war of attrition, the United States and Kyiv's other allies are watching to see if Kim's visit paves the way for a supply of artillery shells to Russia. Russia has joined China in opposing new sanctions on North Korea, blocking a US-led push and publicly splitting the UN Security Council for the first time since it started punishing Pyongyang in 2006. Asked about military co-operation, Putin said Russia complied with international rules but that there were opportunities to explore. The choice to meet at Vostochny Cosmodrome — a symbol of Russia's ambitions as a space power — was notable, as North Korea has twice failed to launch reconnaissance satellites in the past four months. After showing Kim around a building where the Angara, Russia's new 42.7-metre space launch rocket, is assembled, Putin said Kim had shown a ""great interest in rocket engineering"" during the visit. Ahead of his meeting with Putin, Kim signed the visitor book in Korean: ""The glory to Russia, which gave birth to the first space conquerors, will be immortal."". Related Story",What factors are motivating the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea?,"The factors motivating the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea include Russia's desire to needle the United States, which supports Ukraine, and to assert its own power. The summit between Putin and Kim provided an opportunity for Russia to demonstrate its support for North Korea and remind Kim of the Soviet Union's past support. Additionally, the visit allowed Russia to showcase its military and aviation capabilities, potentially paving the way for future military cooperation. The excerpt also mentions the possibility of North Korea receiving a supply of artillery shells from Russia, which the United States and its allies are monitoring. However, it is unclear how far Russia is willing to go in fulfilling North Korea's technology-related wishes.",5b5696f3ca43e68e53f0c321d95cce93

6,"Is cement the solution to storing renewable energy? Engineers at MIT think so.; Supercapacitors could make powering your home and electric vehicles easier and more sustainable. ABSTRACT. . Supercapacitors could make powering your home and electric vehicles easier and more sustainable.  FULL TEXT. . Link to Image. MIT researchers say they have developed an energy storage system that could allow homes to store their own power without external batteries and highways to charge electric vehicles as they traveled on the road - no charging stations needed.  And the best part, the researchers say, is their system, called a supercapacitor, could be built from three of the world's most abundant materials: cement, water, and carbon.  The researchers, who work at MIT's Concrete Sustainability Hub, recently reported their breakthrough in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a peer-reviewed scientific journal. They detailed how a tiny prototype - around 1 centimeter wide and 1 millimeter thick - powered an LED light at least 10,000 times.  The next step: developing large-scale supercapacitors to store wind, solar and other renewable energy to help accelerate the transition from fossil fuels.  Link to Image. ""Energy storage is a global problem,"" said Franz-Josef Ulm, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at MIT and one of the creators of the supercapacitor. ""If we want to curb the environmental footprint, we need to get serious and come up with innovative ideas to reach these goals."". The supercapacitor, still years from commercialization, is part of the drive to improve storage systems considered critical to modernizing the power grid and do it with cheap, widely available materials. In 2022, MIT released a report saying that storing renewable energy using large batteries was not practical financially or technologically because of the cost and difficulty obtaining critical components such as lithium, cobalt, and rare earth minerals.  But engineers at MIT are not the only one's looking to solve this problem.",What is the potential impact of MIT's supercapacitor technology on energy storage and the transition to renewable energy?,"MIT's supercapacitor technology has the potential to revolutionize energy storage by allowing homes to store their own power without the need for external batteries and enabling highways to charge electric vehicles as they travel on the road, eliminating the need for charging stations. The system, built from cement, water, and carbon, offers a sustainable and cost-effective solution to storing renewable energy. This breakthrough could accelerate the transition from fossil fuels by improving storage systems and solving the financial and technological challenges associated with large batteries. The supercapacitor's ability to power an LED light at least 10,000 times demonstrates its durability and practicality. However, it is important to note that the technology is still in the prototype stage and commercialization will take time.",1714e9ac7756cfbb51597053ef1c2369

6,"""The focus of the renewable energy world has largely been on solar and wind energy.  ""However, in recent years, biofuels have drawn a lot of attention as a potentially fruitful direction in the search for long-term fixes. This shift in emphasis is caused by the realisation that biofuels have the ability to industrially address energy supply and security."". In recent years, India has focused on boosting the role of biofuel in the country's energy mix.  ""As India strives to meet its climate and environmental objectives, expanding biofuel usage becomes a crucial component of its strategy to combat climate change and reduce its carbon footprint,"" says Ashvin Patil, founder and director of Biofuels Junction, a Mumbai-based company that manufactures and aggregates solid biofuels.  An added benefit for India is that the production of biofuels creates employment opportunities in rural areas, helping to alleviate poverty and promote economic development, says Mr Dabkara.  The main form of biofuel produced in India is ethanol, which comes from sugar cane and is used for transport as a blend with petrol in cars and other vehicles.  This is something that the government has been promoting, with India achieving its goal of 10 per cent ethanol blending in petrol last year.  The government is now aiming to achieve 20 per cent ethanol blending in petrol by 2026.  Emissions from vehicles is a significant challenge for India, as it has some of the world's most polluted cities.  Biofuels can play an important role in providing a low-carbon solution in transport, including trucking, shipping and aviation, according to the International Energy Agency.  A significant increase in biofuels production is required globally to help bring down carbon emissions, it says.  Are biofuels about to be sold at UAE petrol stations?. Biodiesel, which is made from vegetable oil or recycled cooking oil, and biogas are other types of biofuels that India produces.

And so it's no surprise that technology has been an attractive destination, and I think it will continue to be in this environment in which you're going to continue to see slowing growth globally.  GIOKOS: Yes, it is really fascinating. You know, the stocks that used to be hedges against inflation or safe haven when interest rates go up has definitely shifted through the years. So what do you make of the fact that, you know, the Fed is now pausing. It's thinking differently about what what's happening within the jobs market, for example, how the markets are responding, the pressure on the banking system. I mean, for example, Goldman Sachs is saying that the risk of recession has dropped dramatically.  HOOPER: So I'm in the camp that believes that we're going to see a bumpy landing, I think that a soft landing assumes that there will be no damage to the economy, and clearly with credit conditionings tightening as much as they have, there will be some damage.  But having said that, I don't think we're going to see a hard landing, I don't think we're going to see a significant recession, and markets are starting to anticipate a better outcome than they had expected earlier this year.  Now, it might be a little too rosy, market expectations, but I do believe that the Fed has ended its rate hike cycle. That has not necessarily become clear to markets, but I think it will, as we get more data and we hear more from the Fed.  I think we'll get a pause in September. We won't get full clarity right away, but the Fed has arguably made a lot of progress towards its goal. It will take time though. And I think the key phrase to use is the lags of monetary policy. It takes time for monetary policies' impact to show up in the economy.",How does the shift in interest rates and the Federal Reserve's pause in rate hikes impact the economy and market expectations?,"The shift in interest rates and the Federal Reserve's pause in rate hikes impact the economy by potentially leading to a bumpy landing.

But while many portrayed the new expanded grouping as an alternative to western blocs like the G7, Delhi doesn't view this as an ""anti-West"" grouping. In fact, France, one of the P-5 (permanent members of the UN Security Council) countries which is also a member of G7, is learnt to have expressed interest in engaging with the BRICS more actively. Whether Paris becomes a member is a question to be agreed through consensus. The new entrants are emerging economies with the potential to scale up. Many belong to the Global South or the developing countries, and want to hedge their bets in the increasingly polarised geopolitical landscape. From Latin America, despite Brazil's reluctance, regional rival Argentina was selected as a new member. With a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of approximately US$610 billion, Argentina is one of the largest economies in Latin America. From Africa, Ethiopia and Egypt made the cut, over Nigeria, Algeria and Senegal. According to the World Bank, Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and one of the fastest-growing economies in the region, with an estimated 6.4% growth in FY 2021/22. Egypt occupies a crucial geo-strategic location — 12 per cent of global trade passes through the Suez Canal — and is a key player in the region. An important economic powerhouse, it is an emerging economy with reforms brought in by the government led by President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. But both Argentina and Egypt have strong economic dependency ties with China. Early this month, Beijing lent a helping hand to Argentina so that it could avert a default with the International Monetary Fund for the second time in 30 days. The cash-strapped country tapped almost $3 billion of a Beijing currency swap line to pay the multilateral lender.

Cuban authorities said they have uncovered a human trafficking ring operated from Russia that recruits Cuban citizens to fight alongside its military forces in Ukraine.  The announcement, made late Monday by Cuba's foreign ministry, comes days after local media in Miami reported on Cubans being taken to Russia to fight. Miami-based AmericaTeVe interviewed several Cubans who said they were in Russia, including two young men who begged for help to leave Russia ""as soon as possible."".

The Kremlin has not commented on the Cuba's announcement.  Russia announced plans last year to boost the size of its armed forces by more than 30% to 1.5 million combat personnel.

Friendship was pledged and closer ties promised, but little changed. Fast forward to today, Russia's war in Ukraine is faltering. And the dynamics between the two leaders are different.  ALEXANDER VINDMAN, FORMER EUROPEAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Certainly it means that Putin is in somewhat of a desperate situation or trying to acquire munitions that are severely depleted during this war effort.",What is the purpose of Kim Jong-un's visit to Russia and what is the expected outcome of the meeting?,"The purpose of Kim Jong-un's visit to Russia is to have a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Western officials believe that this meeting will likely lead to an arms deal between North Korea and Russia. The expected outcome of the meeting is a strengthening of ties between the two leaders and a potential agreement on weapons sales, despite U.S. warnings. This is supported by the statement from Alexander Vindman, a former European Affairs Director, who suggests that Putin may be seeking to acquire munitions that have been depleted during Russia's war effort in Ukraine.",99aca1f5baae25d35d41bdd4e54551a4
6,"The crucial factor is that these minerals are controlled by a few countries. Control Of A Few Countries, China Factor ""For lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements, the world's top-three producing nations control well over three-quarters of the global output. In some cases, a single country is responsible for around half of worldwide production. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and China were responsible for some 70% and 60% of global production of cobalt and rare earth elements, respectively, in 2019,"" according to IEA. China also dominates some of the segments, particularly processing. IEA estimates show that China's share of refining is around 35% for nickel, 50-70% for lithium and cobalt, and about 90% for rare earth elements. Chinese firms have made a raft of investments in assets in Australia, Chile, DRC and Indonesia. The supply chain for such minerals has become complex due to control by a handful of countries. ""The level of concentra  tion is even higher for processing and refining operations. China has gained a strong presence across the board. China's share of refining is around 35% for nickel (the figure becomes higher when including the involvement of Chinese companies in Indonesian operations), 50-70% for lithium and cobalt, and as high as 90% for REE processing that converts mined output into oxides, metals and magnets,"" according to the IEA report. The race for these critical minerals -key to achieving climate goals -has prompted a wave of policy responses from governments and companies. The US, the European Union, Australia and Canada have enacted regulations and policies for sustained supply of these critical minerals. Countries have also resorted to curbs on imports and exports. Countries, Firms Jump Into The Fray ""Among resource-rich countries Indonesia, Namibia and Zimbabwe have introduced measures to ban the export of unbeneficiated mineral ore. Globally, export restrictions on critical raw materials have seen a fivefold increase since 2009,"" says IEA.",Why is control of certain minerals by a few countries a concern when it comes to achieving climate goals?,"Control of certain minerals by a few countries is a concern when it comes to achieving climate goals because these minerals are crucial for technologies necessary to transition to clean energy and combat climate change. As stated in the excerpt, the world's top-three producing nations control over three-quarters of the global output of lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements. This concentration of control, particularly by China, creates a supply chain that is vulnerable to disruptions and geopolitical tensions. To ensure a sustained supply of these critical minerals, governments and companies have enacted regulations and policies, and some countries have even implemented export restrictions. This highlights the importance of diversifying the sources of these minerals and promoting sustainable mining practices in order to meet the demand for renewable energy technologies and achieve climate goals.",1fbee6b6ee5888774f0680bb98e3e1d4

Analyst Christine Cho initiated the stock with an overweight rating. Her $31 price target suggests 18.9% upside from where shares closed on Tuesday. The stock has gained more than 50% year to date. Fluence Energy provides ""energy storage technology solutions, delivering hardware along with advanced tech/AI-powered services to optimize the storage assets – either from a revenue-generating perspective and/or an O & M standpoint,"" Cho said in a Wednesday note. ""Given the rapid expected buildout of renewables and the intermittency issues inherent in wind and solar projects, energy storage will be a key piece in the energy transition."" The firm expects Fluence Energy to increase its revenue at a 46% compound annual growth rate from 2022 to 2025, which is double the firm's expectations for utility-scale solar companies. Cho also expects the company to become profitable some time in the latter half of 2024. ""Gross margins are expected to continue its upward trajectory, especially as legacy lower-margin bookings roll off through 1H24 for FLNC,"" the analyst said. ""We also expect FLNC's Services business to grow at a rapid pace at attractive margins."" According to the note, the energy storage is at an earlier part of the transition cycle than wind and solar partly because costs for batteries have historically been high and raw materials are in short supply. But, with most of these issues having been alleviated, Cho expects costs to continue decreasing and Fluence to grow its top line at a faster rate than utility-scale solar names. Cho also initiated energy storage network provider Stem with an equal weight rating and $6 price target, which implies a 10.3% upside from Tuesday's close. Shares of the company have declined more than 39% in 2023, with a substantial amount of those losses from this month. —CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.","According to Barclays analyst Christine Cho, Fluence Energy is poised to be a winner in the renewable energy transition.

(Updated at 1955 GMT)  By Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Ankika Biswas  Aug 22 (Reuters) - Brazil's real jumped against the dollar on Tuesday as BRICS leaders kicked off a summit in Johannesburg, with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva saying he is in favor of embattled neighbor Argentina joining the bloc.   The real appreciated 0.9% against the U.S. dollar, steering a 0.8% advance in the MSCI Latam currencies index .  Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said a tax reform that will restructure Brazil's complex consumption taxes - a key step in Lula's plan to boost economic growth - will be finalised this year.

6,"""You had to be careful because you could fit your foot in them,"" he said.  Cover crops are now used on about 30% of olive groves in Spain, according to Spain's agriculture ministry, with scientists and companies expecting rapid growth in the next few years.  The changes are being driven both by European Union environmental incentives and stark realities. Spain's drought-hit olive oil production slumped to 663,000 tonnes last year, less than half the average of 1.45 million tons recorded in the previous four harvests, according to the government.  Spain's largest olive producers co-operative Dcoop said it expected a similarly low harvest for this year due to drought.  Wine output in Italy is forecast to fall 12% this year after extreme weather and fungal diseases hit vineyards, meaning Italy will lose its position as the world's largest wine producer to France.  Scientists say restoring cover crops such as grasses and legumes in the rows between olive trees can act as a sponge to conserve water, prevent flash floods and restore nutrients.  In the short term, the practice may reduce yields but it can increase oil quality and protect soil for future harvests, a 2019 study in the Journal of Nutrition and Plant Science found.  Spain is already a pioneer in methods to save water, used in almost every stage of olive oil production, said Gonzalo Delacamara, director of the IE Centre for Water & Climate Adaptation in Madrid.  Cover crops ""function as micro-reservoirs that mean each drop of rainwater stays on the ground longer before running off, so that water is more likely to penetrate,"" said Emilio Gonzalez, a professor in rural engineering at the University of Cordoba.  The bare soil still seen in most of southern Spain's olive orchards was not always the norm.  Tilling and clearing vegetation became widespread with the introduction of industrial pesticides and fertilizers in the 1960s and 1970s, said Antonio Manzaneda, professor in ecology at the University of Jaen.  The European Union has a target of reducing nutrient loss by 50% by 2030. In January, it began subsidising farmers who use cover crops as part of the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).",What is the purpose of using cover crops in olive groves and vineyards in Spain and Italy?,"The purpose of using cover crops in olive groves and vineyards in Spain and Italy is to conserve water, prevent flash floods, restore nutrients, and protect the soil. Scientists have found that restoring cover crops between olive trees can act as a sponge, helping to retain water and improving soil quality for future harvests. Additionally, using cover crops can help to meet European Union environmental incentives and targets, such as reducing nutrient loss and promoting sustainable agriculture. The use of cover crops is driven by the need to adapt to challenges such as drought and extreme weather, which have negatively impacted olive oil and wine production in Spain and Italy. By implementing cover crops, farmers can mitigate these challenges and improve the overall quality and sustainability of their crops.",a183fccaf36dd9d12480c77bb1cc9d67

6,"Report Reveals ESG Supports' Campaign To Influence Regulators. am EDT|. In January 2016, a group of investors and regulators convened at the Manhattan headquarters of the United Nations for a summit co-hosted by the environmental activist nonprofit group Ceres.  The reported purpose of the Investor Summit on Climate Risk was to organize billions of dollars in private investment to finance the clean energy transition. But a subsequent recap of the meeting found an organized effort to leverage Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment analysis, financial divestment, and ""death-by-disclosure"" to undermine America's traditional energy industry.  A report published last month by Consumer's Research details Ceres's efforts to influence the Securities and Exchange Commission and other government officials in a decade-long mission to impose climate disclosures on public energy companies.  To build its case, Ceres uses its investor networks to create the appearance of mass investor demand for climate disclosure, and force disclosure into the market via shareholder activism. The goal of this strategy – to decapitalize the oil and gas industry – was made clear at the 2016 investor summit where one attendee described the approach as ""divestment through value destruction."". The 2016 summit's objectives seemed a stretch at the time; less so today. Wall Street, progressive politicians and environmental activists have used the ESG framework to weaponize the corporate governance system against U.S. energy companies.  The strategy to push financial giants and regulators to decapitalize the oil and gas industry goes much deeper than investor conferences, though, and the consequences have had wide-ranging impacts that harm consumers and the free market.  Ceres has largely flown under the radar despite its immense influence in political and financial circles. The Consumer's Research report details how Ceres used affiliate and owned groups like Climate Action 100+ and the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative to pressure asset managers, state financial officials, and regulators to support costly disclosure frameworks.  The report shines a light on a strategy to build influence with financial regulators and use public companies' shareholder resolution process to promote climate-related financial disclosures. This aligns with broader trends in the business world where environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors have gained prominence in investment decisions and corporate practices.",How has the organization Ceres used ESG investment analysis and shareholder activism to undermine America's traditional energy industry?,"The organization Ceres has utilized ESG investment analysis and shareholder activism to undermine America's traditional energy industry by leveraging its investor networks to create the appearance of mass investor demand for climate disclosure.

(Courtesy The Walk Productions/Igor Emerich) She's roughly three times the height of an average 10-year-old girl. At 12 feet tall, she towers above most other puppets – she even has about four feet over Big Bird. Over the weekend, Bostonians will feel her larger than life presence in-person as she arrives on the commonwealth's shores for the start of her journey across the United States. While she's made of lightweight materials, such as cane and carbon-fiber, and requires three puppeteers at one time to operate, she's also a symbol of refugee displaced populations now widely recognized across the world. Her name is Little Amal, ""hope"" in Arabic. She's designed by Handspring Puppet Company of South Africa, the company responsible for the lauded main character in ""War Horse.""",What is the purpose of Little Amal's journey across the United States?,"The purpose of Little Amal's journey across the United States is to raise awareness about the plight of refugees worldwide.

6,"So, if it is to win a war of attrition, it has to commit itself to switching huge resources into military industries for many years to come.  How long can democracies do this, with ageing populations requiring much greater social spending and the enormous costs of mitigating and controlling climate chaos? Given that the Ukraine war is now almost a decade old, is another decade of attrition sustainable?. Can it go on until Ukraine attains those three, currently improbable, war aims? If the answer is no, the only logical strategy for the West would seem to be to help Ukraine to define victory differently.  After all, Ukraine has already scored some staggering wins. It has stopped an imperialist butcher in his tracks. It has emerged as a proud and largely unified nation. It has created itself as a European country, deeply embedded in the hearts of democrats everywhere.  Victory surely looks like the institutionalisation of those triumphs: the emergence of Ukraine as a full democracy and a member of the European Union, with international guarantees for its security and generous help to rebuild itself.  There is probably more fighting to be done in the next few months before sober reflection can make this clear. In the meantime, the fog of war should not be thickened by fantasies.","What are the potential challenges for democracies in sustaining a war of attrition, considering factors such as aging populations, social spending, and mitigating climate change?","The potential challenges for democracies in sustaining a war of attrition include the need to allocate significant resources to military industries for an extended period of time. However, democracies also face the pressures of aging populations, which require increased social spending, as well as the enormous costs of mitigating and controlling climate chaos. These factors raise questions about the sustainability of a war of attrition for another decade. The article suggests that democracies may need to redefine victory for Ukraine and provide support in areas such as establishing a full democracy, becoming a member of the European Union, and receiving international guarantees for security and assistance in rebuilding.",cc4ba9d08e1aca76e2b584b379a6e9e0

6,"Its founders include Brazil, which has its own agenda, and India. Both states have adopted their own versions of neutrality in the Ukrainian crisis, first in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine,then after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022.  So far, says Oliver Stuenkel, a professor at Brazil's Getulio Vargas Foundation, the two states have resisted Russia's systematic bid to use an explicitly anti-Western vocabulary in BRICS documents. This, he says, would explain the vague tone of the group's resolutions.  South Africa, the last member to join the group (in 2010), is a lesser power in terms of economy and political clout. But it symbolizes the worldwide spirit the group would come to embody.  In its first decade, the big four BRIC economies appeared as an emerging, southern engine of global economic growth. That isn't the impression today, and the group's original and largely developmental vocation may change further with the entry of new members, due in January 2024.  If China and Russia have their way, the BRICS will represent a political challenge to the West and the global North, mounted from the East and the South. The new members include states grappling with some hefty economic and debt issues, like Argentina and Egypt, which limit their autonomy. Three others, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia, are strong enough to sustain independent foreign policies and a sixth new member, Ethiopia, maintains fluid, strategic and business ties with both the United States and China.  The expansion thus had seemed balanced enough... until a last-minute decision to include the Islamic Republic of Iran. Just that alone will rule out any idea of the group taking the middle-ground in diplomatic spats.

And at first, you're like okay, that number kind of -- you know it's kind of high, but really that's just half the people polled. Half the people in this country are Republicans. And I think it is because of that media protection. Does anybody outside of Fox News know that people within the Obama administration actually thought that Viktor Shokin was doing a good job and praised him for his anti-corruption stance.  Meanwhile, Joe Biden fired him because of the corruption claim that he was making. This is the guy that by the way, was investigating Burisma, the company that was paying Hunter Biden.

6,"So this might then open the way for the Spanish sporting tribunals and bodies to take more of a stance. They looked into charges of misconduct last week. They said they decided that it could be only described as a serious offense.  Rather than a very serious offense, which is the bar by which they are able to take action? So you wonder at what point in these legal processes that would give the sporting tribunals more grounds to take action of their own?. ASHER: Yes, we await some kind of reaction from Rubiales on the possibility that he may indeed face criminal charges. We will be watching closely Amanda Davies live for us there. Thank you so much.  All right, more now on the American trapped inside one of Turkey's deepest caves. 40-year-old Mark Dickey fell ill while he was about 1100 meters below the surface with gastrointestinal bleeding. Turkish officials say the operation to bring Dickey could begin tomorrow and it will take approximately four days.  Nada Bashir joins us live now. So Nada, here you have a man who is about thousand meters below ground, the sort of operation to bring him to the surface would be a complicated one, even for a healthy person and when you add to the fact that he may need a stretcher, just walk us through how much that does indeed complicate things?. NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Yes, absolutely Zain. This is a deeply complex operation. We're talking about a mission that could take days several multinational teams involved in this rescue effort. And as you mentioned that this is an individual who isn't in the best state when it comes to health?. Of course, there are concerns around the pressure put around the stomach area that is where he suffered that injury earlier this week. So that is a key area of concern. That is something that the teams on the ground are considering before they make the decision whether or not to begin that rescue effort tomorrow.","What are the challenges and complications involved in the operation to rescue Mark Dickey from the deep cave in Turkey, considering his health condition and the need for a stretcher?","The operation to rescue Mark Dickey from the deep cave in Turkey is complicated due to several factors. Firstly, the operation itself is challenging, even for a healthy person, given the depth and complexity of the cave system. Secondly, Dickey's health condition adds an additional layer of complexity, as he suffered gastrointestinal bleeding while being approximately 1100 meters below the surface. The teams involved in the rescue effort are concerned about the pressure on his stomach area, considering his injury. Furthermore, Dickey may require a stretcher, which further complicates the rescue operation.

I think you're going to start to see some very serious and some very difficult questions about how do you try to get the Russians and the Ukrainians to the negotiating table.  MARQUARDT: This is a major worry of the Ukrainians that what happens if they don't have success in this counter offensive. Katie Bo Lillis, as always, terrific reporting. Thank you so much for joining us. Appreciate it.  For more on the story, I'm joined now by CNN military analyst Colonel Cedric Leighton and McCain Institute Executive Director Evelyn Farkas who is a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense. Thank you both for joining us. Evelyn, I want to follow on some of Katie Bo's reporting. When it comes to Crimea, do you think that this is an either or question that Ukraine should be training all of its focus on the counteroffensive or is there a benefit to also hitting Crimea at the same time?. EVELYN FARKAS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MCCAIN INSTITUTE: Yes, Alex, I don't think it's in either or or either or. I think that they can hit those logistics hubs, the ammunition depots, all of the infrastructure that the Russian troops in the east and the south rely on coming through Crimea, coming from Russia through Crimea to the rest of Ukraine. So I think it is important to continue to target those areas. But at the same time, yes, they need to be focused on the counter offensive. In the south, they have two avenues of approach and in the east they have one.  And I think that's what the administration has also focused, Katie, also mentioned it, Katie Bo mentioned it in her earlier segment, you know, basically the administration seems to want Ukraine to focus one avenue of attack.",Should Ukraine focus all of its efforts on the counteroffensive or also target Crimea in their military operations?,"According to Evelyn Farkas, the former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense, Ukraine does not have to choose between focusing solely on the counteroffensive or targeting Crimea. Farkas believes that Ukraine should continue targeting logistics hubs, ammunition depots, and infrastructure that the Russian troops rely on in the east and south, which come through Crimea. However, Ukraine should also remain focused on the counteroffensive, particularly in the south where they have two avenues of approach, and in the east where they have one. This approach allows Ukraine to target critical areas while simultaneously pushing back against Russian aggression.",8010cec57c86849d8e99a77c87427d0e
6,"… The heat is paralyzing in some facilities."". Executive Office of Public Safety spokesperson Elaine Driscoll said the Department of Correction is ""committed to maintaining safe, secure environments and taking proactive measures to ensure those living and working in the facilities stay hydrated and cool."" She added that all cells have direct ventilation, and inmates have access to ice water and loaner fans in some prisons.  Prisoner advocates and investigators from the Disability Law Center say that, whatever the state's standards are, relief from heat is inconsistent, and often subject to the whims of administrators. They have piles of complaints from those inside about windows that don't open, air conditioning on the blink or not switched on, and water that is always lukewarm.  In the state's jails, it's entirely up to the sheriffs whether those locked up – many of whom are awaiting trial and have not been convicted – get meaningful relief from the heat. There, too, there is immense inconsistency. In Worcester County, Sheriff Lew Evangelidis appears to take a hard line. White says Prisoners' Legal Services gets more heat complaints from inmates there than in any other county. A spokesman for the sheriff did not respond to a call seeking comment.  In Bristol County, only 114 of the 600 or so people incarcerated there have air conditioning, though there, Sheriff Paul Heroux is trying to do something about it. He says the temperature in some of his units reaches 95 degrees, even at night. He is installing air conditioning in some units and hopes to have climate control for every cell within a couple of years. And he plans to close the notorious Ash Street jail, an aged building where conditions are generally appalling.  ""This is our responsibility,"" Heroux said. ""By improving the conditions for inmates, we also improve work conditions for the COs."" Even the officers who ""hate"" him see the sense in that, he said.  Chance should not decide whether an inmate is held in a potentially deadly oven.","What are some of the issues faced by inmates in regards to heat relief in Massachusetts prisons, and what is Sheriff Paul Heroux doing to address these issues?","In Massachusetts prisons, inmate complaints about lack of heat relief include windows that don't open, malfunctioning or nonexistent air conditioning, and consistently lukewarm water. In Bristol County, only 114 out of 600 incarcerated individuals have air conditioning, and temperatures in some units reach 95 degrees, even at night. Sheriff Paul Heroux is working to address these issues by installing air conditioning in some units and aiming to provide climate control for every cell within a couple of years. He also plans to close the Ash Street jail, a facility known for its poor conditions.

""Any abrupt weakening of China's industrial activity and oil demand is likely to spill over globally, making for a more challenging climate for emerging markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America."". Estimates of global demand and supply this year and next differ markedly depending on the forecaster.  Both the IEA and OPEC - in its monthly report published on Tuesday - are optimistic about Chinese demand over the course of 2023, leaving their global demand estimates for this year and next largely unchanged.  Meanwhile, the U.S government's Energy Information Administration on Tuesday was generally less upbeat on demand and more buoyant on supply for 2024, and forecast a considerable downward revision in consumption and a slight hike in non-OPEC supply.

So we need to start to think about what should we be doing differently that will get us there.  But we can't do this with an exclusive kind of conversation. We need to have an inclusive conversation, one that includes NGOs, civil society, indigenous people activist, but one that also includes industry, CEOs, leaders those who have the resources, the technology, the engineers, the ability to make the changes, and to help us to solve these quite frankly, hard conversations.  We're as a COP Presidency, our COP Presidency of the UAE. And yes, our oil and gas company is part of a group of companies who are working with us to try to find solutions. But we as a COP Presidency are holding this industry to task. We're saying everybody is welcome to come to the UAE, who when they come, we want to make sure that they are bringing their solutions.  They're bringing their ideas, and we're setting a very high bar for how they can participate in COP28.

6,"ICAR scientists have already demonstrated that even basic staple crops such as wheat, rice, maize, and millet can be bio-fortified with enhanced iron, zinc, and even anti-oxidants. ICAR has created 87 varieties of climate-resistant and nutritious crops. These crops include rice (8), wheat (28), maize (14), pearl millet (9), finger millet (3), small millet (1), lentil (2), groundnut (2), linseed (1), mustard (6), soybean (5), cauliflower (1), potato (2), sweet potato (2), greater yam (2), and pomegranate (1) varieties, which were developed as a result of collaboration between national and international organisations. However, the dissemination of this research to the Global South is equally important for India. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has released zinc-rich rice and wheat, which can be shared with countries of the Global South. Biofortification is much more cost-effective compared to supplementing rice with nutrients, say iron, in our public distribution system. But India spends only 0.48 per cent of agri-GDP on agri-R&D. This needs to be doubled, if the country has to play the role of a leader.  The AWG also highlights the ""significance of strengthening a rules-based, open, predictable, transparent, non-discriminatory, inclusive, equitable and sustainable multilateral trading system"". It also emphasises working together to improve our food systems by strengthening local, regional, and international agri-food value chains. This can lead to affordable and accessible food, agricultural inputs, and products. A sustainable multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, can increase market predictability and boost business confidence.  1  Anurag Kashyap says he feels 'guilty' about asking Vicky Kaushal to do his films now, because he can no longer afford him. 2  Breaking: India's World Cup team finalised, Sanju Samson misses out.

The hair disaster occurred on July 12, while the 41-year-old was performing at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field stadium as part of her Renaissance World Tour.

6,"Startup That Lets You Instantly Talk in Foreign Language Targets a Nasdaq IPO at $1 Billion Value. (Bloomberg) -- The maker of Japan's most popular voice-and-camera translator is fighting to differentiate itself as it pursues a listing on Nasdaq in two years at a billion-dollar valuation.  Pocketalk Corp., spun out of Tokyo-based Sourcenext Corp., sells handheld devices that can translate 85 languages. Since its launch in 2017, the startup sold a total of 1.1 million machines, with its recent Pocketalk S model priced at $249. It plans to sell another 1 million in 11 countries within three years through a partnership with SoftBank Group Corp.'s mobile unit.  Shares of parent Sourcenext jumped as much as 10% in Tokyo on the news Friday, the biggest intraday gain in seven weeks.  Pocketalk's endeavor at a global rollout and US listing stand out among Japanese startups, which tend to stay tethered to their home market, the world's third-largest economy.  Going abroad means facing a world awash with translation tools, including lineups from China's iFlytek Co., Timekettle and Cheetah Mobile Inc., as well as Vasco Electronics, founded in Poland. Pocketalk says its strength lies in its ability to choose from a pool of six to seven translation engines to yield the best results. The startup taps resources including translation services from Google, OpenAI and DeepL GmbH, using patented source code to provide the most accurate and natural translation, said Noriyuki Matsuda, chief executive officer of Pocketalk and parent Sourcenext.  ""We choose the best, accurate engine for each combination,"" of source languages and translated texts, Matsuda said in an interview.  Translation apps have come a long way, but fall short in making conversations sound natural, Matsuda said.

6,"How North Korea can alter the balance of power in Asia and the Pacific. A trilateral partnership involving Russia and China could disrupt US-led plans in the East. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin have forged an agreement that appears convenient for both parties in the context of their strategic standoff with the US and its allies.  More importantly, a trilateral partnership may be emerging between China, Russia and North Korea that sends a message of defiance to Washington and its partners in the Quad – including Australia, India and Japan – and allies such as South Korea.  The message appears to be that China and Russia now have on their side a country that can cause disruptions in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.  The Kim-Putin meeting came hot on the heels of US President Joe Biden's visit to Vietnam, which China will have closely followed. Earlier, at the G20 summit in New Delhi, the Biden administration also announced an economic corridor project involving India, key Arab Gulf countries and Europe. Beijing might view the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) as a competitor to its own Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which it launched a decade ago as a fundamental infrastructure component of its strategic vision.  The emergence of these new geopolitical partnerships foreshadows possible global confrontations of indeterminate scope and dimensions.  The China-Russia-North Korea partnership has the potential to alter the balance of power in Asia and the Pacific. Following Mr Kim's visit to Russia, the Kremlin might be able to essentially convey to the West that if it needs to deal with a capricious, nuclear-armed and occasionally provocative state such as North Korea, it will need to involve Moscow and Beijing.  Russia and China are increasingly committed to enhancing their strategic co-operation in the Asia-Pacific, irrespective of the latter's stance on the war in Ukraine. Indeed, these are two distinct matters, and the two countries' focus is squarely on fortifying the strategic, military and political dimensions of their partnership through various means, including their favourable relations with the North Korean regime.  BRI is different from IMEEC in that it is Chinese-led and Chinese-funded, while the latter is a multilateral project.","What message does a trilateral partnership between China, Russia, and North Korea send to the US and its allies in the Asia-Pacific region?","A trilateral partnership between China, Russia, and North Korea sends a message of defiance to the US and its allies in the Asia-Pacific region.

6,"This is a kibbutz that had an agricultural part, there was avocado orchards, but then there was also an irrigation tubing factory. And there were jobs like in the dining hall, and there were jobs in the children's center, and people sort of rotated through different jobs, and everybody contributed to the maintenance of this community. It was such an eye-opener to me that you could live in a community, a big community with a ton of other people, and you could have like a functioning sort of micro-economy and reimagine the way that you lived your daily lives. And that it would—it starts to sort of change the way you think about yourself and the world.  Lauren Goode: I debated whether or not to share this, but I actually grew up in something of a group living situation. My mother's parents, my maternal grandparents, bought a cluster of houses. This was in a city and there were four houses all, you know, next door to each other or directly across the street from each other. And then eventually a great aunt bought a fifth house a couple doors down. And so I grew up completely surrounded by aunts and uncles and cousins and my maternal grandparents next door who really helped raise us. I mean, got us ready for school in the morning and cooked for us. And I like to say that my aunts were my Uber drivers to Catholic school [laughter], but I also, I think, found it overwhelming at times. You describe yourself as an introvert in the book. I think I too am an introvert. I think I was understanding from a young age that boundaries could be pushed, although I couldn't perhaps articulate it then. And I think some of the conflicts that arose amongst family members are probably brushed on my brain just as well as the upsides of that living situation are.  Kristen Ghodsee: For each of us there's going to be a balance between privacy and community that is gonna be individual. Like not everybody is gonna want the same thing. And that's good.

6,"Article II of the Constitution gives the president immense powers over foreign affairs. Unlike the economy or the climate, foreign policy is an area that a president can truly shape and define. Arguably, no issue is more important: The choices made by a president can be the difference between war and peace. Contrary to popular perceptions, Americans seem to intuitively grasp the importance of foreign policy, and periodically, elections turn into great battles between distinct visions of America's role in the world and thus America's character as a nation. When raised, foreign policy issues go to the heart of the American experiment in democracy — which, after all, began as a foreign policy crisis against a great empire.  Today, the major divide between liberals and conservatives is not over troop numbers or funding commitments — and voters would forget these quickly anyway. Rather, it is over what the American future will look like. What the world shaped by America will resemble. The Republican primary is going to yield one clear answer. But the Democrats do not have one.  At last month's Republican debate, the second- and third-leading candidates, Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy, both challenged the consensus of further supporting Ukraine. Ramaswamy has pledged, in nationalist terms, to stop all support for Ukraine and actually build a partnership with Russia to check China. (This reversal of what Richard Nixon did in the Cold War sounds better on paper than it would likely be in reality.) More establishment candidates like Mike Pence and Nikki Haley have stuck to the hawkish script of continuing to militarily check Russia and China. The point is that in front of millions of Americans, the Republican Party is airing out differences and debating the principles that should guide America's foreign policy.  As for Donald Trump, the GOP front- runner, he has promised to end the war in Ukraine on day one. He wants massive new tariffs on all goods imported into the United States. He will toughen immigration laws. Trump's foreign policy vision is clear: protectionism, militarism, and nationalism.",What is Vivek Ramaswamy's stance on supporting Ukraine in terms of American foreign policy?,"Vivek Ramaswamy, a candidate in the Republican primary, has challenged the consensus of further supporting Ukraine and has pledged, in nationalist terms, to stop all support for Ukraine.

With the 15th BRICS Summit held in South Africa from Aug 22 to 24, there has been much speculation about its future prospects.  Some Western media have sought to stir up trouble by reporting India and Brazil oppose the much-anticipated discussions on the expansion of BRICS, and that the Indian leader would not be attending the summit. These ill-intentioned claims were rebutted by South Africa's Foreign Minister who said someone was ""trying to spoil the summit"". Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did attend and Brazil and India support the expansion of BRICS, they only seek elucidation on the entry rules.  BRICS has attracted the interest of over 20 countries, including Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, Venezuela, and the United Arab Emirates, which have expressed a desire to be part of the group, as well as more observer nations keen on joining the path to membership.  According to data published by the United Kingdom-based economic research firm Acorn Macro Consulting, even with only its present membership, BRICS already represents 31.5 percent of the global GDP, more than the G7's 30 percent, and BRICS represents 43 percent of the world's population.

It's not something that Iran can just use to spend kind of on whatever it wants, like its missile development, for example, or on its nuclear program.  These are funds that are going to be closely monitored by Qatar, by the U.S. Treasury Department, and they will only be able to be disbursed periodically and for humanitarian reasons, like food, medicine, medical supplies, agricultural devices, things that Iran and its population clearly desperately need. And that is the administration's argument here, is that they are providing this money, which is not U.S. taxpayer money, it is frozen Iranian funds that were given to them from oil sales years ago that have been frozen in South Korean bank accounts that are now going to be sent into Qatari bank accounts, that Qatar will then be able to monitor and disburse, again, with the oversight of the U.S. Treasury Department.  So, the U.S. is saying, look, this is the best deal that we were able to get.

Trump is scheduled to surrender for booking at Fulton County jail and be released on $200,000 bond, for which he must post 10%. Trump faces 13 charges, including racketeering, soliciting state officials to violate their oaths of office, making false statements and conspiring to recruit alternate presidential electors.  ATLANTA − Donald Trump arrived in Atlanta on Thursday evening, where he's expected to surrender at the Fulton County Jail on charges he tried to steal the 2020 election, the fourth criminal case he faces while campaigning for president next year.  Trump is one of 19 defendants in the indictment that alleges racketeering by a criminal organization that tried to overturn the election results. Local authorities said Trump would be treated like any other defendant.  But the processing contrasts to his three other cases, in New York, Florida and Washington, D.C., where he was processed at a courthouse during the same trip when he entered a formal plea to charges. Trump's Georgia arraignment is expected the week of Sept. 5.  Here is what we know about the case:. What is racketeering?. The federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act originated in 1970 to fight organized crime by allowing prosecutors to target people at the top of criminal organizations.  States then passed their own RICO laws so prosecutors could charge multiple people involved in a conspiracy together if they were working toward a common goal.  Georgia's RICO law, adopted in 1980, makes it a crime to participate in, acquire or maintain control of an ""enterprise"" through a ""pattern of racketeering activity"" or to conspire to do so. The alleged scheme does not have to have been successful for a RICO charge to be proven.  − Ryan Randazzo. Where is Fulton County?. Fulton County is located in northwest Georgia.

Underpinning the AOIP is ASEAN centrality in the Indo-Pacific region, and this was already recognized by all the major powers even before the AOIP came into being in 2019.  The attendance of big powers in many ASEAN forums, including the ASEAN foreign ministers' meetings, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), attest to the group's role in regional and international affairs. This centrality however is contingent upon ASEAN as a group remaining neutral in the Sino-US rivalry. While member states may be aligning with one or the other power, ASEAN as a group must remain neutral, lest it forfeit its centrality. ASEAN, though, is not without internal challenges that raise questions about its unity, and therefore its effectiveness in playing a central role in the region. One issue that is dividing the group is the membership of Myanmar since the military seized power in 2021 and ruled the country by killing and brutally suppressing its people.  For now, Myanmar has been excluded from all high-level meetings, but the issue is already dividing ASEAN, and raising questions about ASEAN's relevance if it cannot put its own house in order. In his speech opening the 43rd ASEAN Summit in Jakarta on Tuesday, President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo rallied his counterparts to stay united even when they hold different opinions. ""I have been hearing questions whether ASEAN will break up and lose its unity, and whether the ASEAN ship can continue sailing,"" he said. ""I have to reiterate that ASEAN unity remains intact.

1,"That's in my lifetime, and your lifetime.  And so, if you took -- look back at all that happened to dismantle us and then to rebuild us and to put us in place where we could actually start focusing on other things, and so, you know, in the '70s, Congress started passing laws called self-determination laws to help tribes with the resources they need to rebuild a nation, to bring back their home lands, to provide for their citizens. So, it look like with all of that history -- but you also realize, it wasn't until the 2000s that our chief even had the legal authority to appoint a delegate.  And so, I think that's a nod to all the rebuilding that we had done to get to a place where we could finally focus on this treaty right, which is, as you mentioned, a valid right today.  MARTIN: So, what would it take for you to be seated, as a nonvoting delegate? And by that, I mean, I think for people -- people in certain parts of country are familiar with this. Residents of the District of Columbia, of Guam, of Puerto Rico, for example, the Virgin Islands, they have nonvoting delegates but they don't have floor voting rights but they have the right to speak on the floor generally. But the most important thing is that they have the right to be seated in committee and to vote in committee. What is the importance of that, in your view, to the Cherokee nation, and frankly, to native people more broadly?. TEEHEE: Well, I think, first of all, let's look at the fact that the treaty is a supreme law of the land. It is the federal law today. And because the Senate ratified the treaty and because the president signed it into law, seating Cherokee nations delegate only requires house action. The house can seat the delegate by resolution. Yes, Congress can pass a law to seat the delegate too, but we don't need the Senate to act again because it did that nearly 200 years ago.","What is the process for the Cherokee nation to have a nonvoting delegate seated in Congress, and why is this important to the Cherokee nation and Native people in general?","The process for the Cherokee nation to have a nonvoting delegate seated in Congress is through a resolution passed by the House of Representatives. This is because the Treaty of New Echota, which granted the Cherokee nation the right to have a delegate, was ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the President. Although Congress could pass a law to seat the delegate, it is not necessary as the Senate's ratification already established the delegate's eligibility. Seating a Cherokee delegate is important to the Cherokee nation and Native people in general because it recognizes the treaty right and allows for representation and participation in congressional committees, giving a voice to their interests and concerns.",944a1e35eb0e6aecea19dccb3b35d856

In the current conjuncture, it is easier to imagine and end to the world than to imagine an end to capitalism. –        Frederic Jameson, Seeds of Time, 1994 One of the rules of lucrative success in American ""public intellectual"" circles is that you must avoid full frontal engagement with the reigning socioeconomic and political order that is actively destroying life on Earth at a lethally escalating pace: capitalism-imperialism.

1,"It may increase regional competition for resources and the demand for military actions, posing a threat to national stability and security, she said.  Xu anticipated that the global decarbonization pressures would also intensify geopolitical tensions. According to her research, 11 countries, including India and Pakistan, would be financially vulnerable to climate change, leading to increasing risks of unrest and migration, and demand for foreign aid in the future.  Ma with the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs said the threat posed by climate change is indeed urgent, and it is a positive step that more than 190 parties have signed the Paris Agreement with a goal to combat climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees above preindustrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees. Nearly 150 countries and regions worldwide have made commitments to achieving carbon neutrality.  ""But meanwhile, the world is facing the impacts of the pandemic, volatility in the energy market, and increasing geopolitical tensions, leading major economies to pay more attention to energy security, food security, and supply chain security. This makes global efforts to address climate change extremely challenging,"" he said.  Difficult situation. In the past two years, carbon emissions have been increasing rather than decreasing. Therefore, there is currently no reliable pathway to achieve the 1.5-degree target, and the overall situation is very difficult, he said.  There are also disputes among developed countries and developing countries as to what kind of responsibilities they should shoulder in tackling climate change, Ma said.  Developing countries, such as those in Africa and small island nations, have very low historical cumulative emissions but are greatly affected by climate change.  Developed countries, on the other hand, have been responsible for the majority of historical emissions since the Industrial Revolution. Although they have recognized their responsibility and made commitments to providing financial compensation to developing countries for climate change mitigation, these promises have yet to be fulfilled, which becomes a major problem that undermines solidarity in global climate governance, Ma said.  The Paris Agreement ultimately reached an agreement on countries' voluntary contributions. However, the global climate situation is pressing and urgent, and the current global response measures are clearly insufficient, thus requiring further enhancement and reinforcement.","What challenges and disputes are hindering global efforts to address climate change, as discussed in the excerpt?","The challenges and disputes hindering global efforts to address climate change, as discussed in the excerpt, include:

1. Increasing geopolitical tensions and volatility in the energy market, which divert attention and resources away from climate change mitigation efforts.
2. The difficulty in achieving the goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius or even 1.5 degrees Celsius, as carbon emissions have been increasing rather than decreasing in the past two years.
3. Disputes between developed and developing countries regarding their responsibilities in tackling climate change. Developing countries, which have low historical cumulative emissions, are greatly affected by climate change, while developed countries, responsible for the majority of historical emissions, have yet to fulfill their promises of financial compensation for climate change mitigation.
4. Insufficient global response measures, as the voluntary contributions outlined in the Paris Agreement are not enough to effectively address the urgent climate situation.

1,"Entomologists tell me this is part of a worldwide phenomenon. We've worked so hard to banish bugs from our lives — destroying their habitats with pavement and lawns, killing them with insecticides and stressing them with climate change — that our cities and suburbs are now insect wastelands but for a few hardy pest species, such as the disease-carrying mosquitoes that feed on the blood of people and pets.  In the country, by contrast, the ecosystem is in better balance. There are actually more mosquitoes here, but a smaller proportion of them dine on human blood and carry disease. Competition with other insects keeps their numbers in check, and the other abundant species in the ecosystem — spiders, frogs, fish and birds — gobble up the mosquitoes.  In other words, the problem isn't that we have too many bugs in cities and suburbs; the problem is that we don't have nearly enough. We've been so successful at vanquishing the little critters that the entire insect world is in big trouble — and so are we if we don't help them to recover.  ""You're experiencing exactly what's happening in many places around the world,"" says Akito Kawahara, a University of Florida entomologist who specializes in insect biodiversity. ""In the wilderness, where there's more diversity of organisms, you have a better balance. In places where it's become urbanized, a few species that are extremely dominant create outbreaks and all kinds of unstable circumstances."" A more robust and diverse insect population means fewer pests. More bees, butterflies and spiders means fewer mosquito bites.  The mosquito paradox is just one piece of a much bigger problem. Multiple studies show that the overall insect population is declining by 1 percent to 2 percent per year, which means losing perhaps a third of all insects on the planet within 20 years — moving us toward what's often called an ""insect apocalypse."" ""Really, there's no debate anymore,"" says Scott Black, head of the Xerces Society, which promotes invertebrate conservation. ""We are seeing the rapid decline of insects pretty much anywhere that they're studied."". It's hard to overstate how ruinous this could be.",Why is the decline of insects in urban areas problematic?,"The decline of insects in urban areas is problematic because it disrupts the ecosystem's balance and leads to an increase in pest populations, such as disease-carrying mosquitoes. In urban areas, where habitats have been destroyed and insecticides have been used, there are fewer insects to compete with pests and keep their populations in check. As a result, the dominance of a few pest species leads to unstable circumstances and outbreaks. Having a more robust and diverse insect population, including bees, butterflies, and spiders, helps control pest populations and reduces issues like mosquito bites. The decline of insects in urban areas is part of a larger problem of overall insect population decline, which has been referred to as an ""insect apocalypse."" This decline threatens biodiversity and could have devastating ecological consequences.",85a24351a68b313f023853c5e5ac5390

1,"Oil investors open to dividend cut to boost clean energy spending -Deloitte. HOUSTON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Major institutional oil and gas investors would be open to receiving lower dividends and fewer share buybacks in favor of more spending on some energy transition projects, consultancy Deloitte said in a study published on Tuesday.  Energy firms have sharply increased shareholder returns on the back of high energy prices after years of overspending on production growth. Oil and gas companies led all industries in cash distribution to shareholders in 2022, with a combined 8% dividend and buyback yield, Deloitte said.  Oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Chevron (CVX.N), BP (BP.L), Equinor (EQNR.OL), Shell (SHEL.L) and TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) collectively paid out a record $110 billion in dividends and share repurchases to investors last year.  But investors holding $2.3 trillion of equity in the global oil and gas industry are changing their expectations about growth markets faster than energy company executives, Deloitte said.  About 75% of surveyed investors stated that they would continue holding shares to accelerate investments in lower-carbon technologies, even if yields shrank to as little as 3%.  ""There are divergent views,"" Deloitte research director Kate Hardin said. ""Probably depending on where you are, with your dividends and share buybacks, you might be able to reduce that a bit."". The study also showed a divergence in spending preferences. About 40% of the 150 C-suite company executives surveyed cited hydrogen and carbon capture and storage technologies as critical for their strategy.  Investors preferred ""more transformational technologies"" such as electrification of transportation and electric charging stations, Hardin said. About 43% of surveyed investors emphasized battery storage as their key area for investment.  ""There's a little bit of a difference there in terms of that longer-term view of what the energy transition may ultimately look like,"" Hardin said.  Executives and investors converged on critical minerals as a key area for investments.",How are major institutional oil and gas investors changing their expectations about growth markets and what areas of the energy transition are they prioritizing for investment?,"Major institutional oil and gas investors are changing their expectations about growth markets by prioritizing investments in lower-carbon technologies.

The co-founder and military commander of the Wagner was buried near Moscow on Thursday, after dying in an unexplained plane crash that also killed his boss Yevgeny Prigozhin.  Dmitry Utkin, 53, whose call-sign ""Wagner"" gave the private army its name, was buried in Mytishchi, on the outskirts of the capital, in a ceremony cordoned off by Russian military police, according to the popular online news channel Shot.  Prigozhin had been buried on Tuesday in an equally discreet ceremony in his hometown of St Petersburg that contrasted starkly with his loud and often foul-mouthed presence on social media.  Before helping to found Wagner as Prigozhin's shadowy right-hand man, Utkin served as a special forces officer in the GRU military intelligence service, where he held the rank of lieutenant colonel.  He fought for Wagner to support Moscow's military campaigns in Syria and Ukraine, and was photographed in 2016 at the Kremlin with president Vladimir Putin.  At the end of June, a source told Reuters that Utkin was the leader of an armed convoy of Wagner mutineers that advanced towards Moscow to back Prigozhin's demand that the military leadership resign over its failures in what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

1,"Experts: Climate change altering monsoon patterns, ringing in extreme weather. Nagpur: Climate change has been altering monsoon patterns in India which has witnessed record-breaking extreme weather events this June and July, say scientists.  While the monsoon season is at the halfway mark, the season so far has been marred by extreme weather events — from humid heatwaves to cyclones to torrential rains. According to an analysis compiled by Climate Trends, July reported the highest number of stations recording 'extremely heavy rain' events in the last five years. ""June saw the highest number of stations witnessing 'very-heavy rainfall' events in the last five years,"" it stated.  As per the data of India Meteorological Department (IMD), as many as 1,113 stations reported very heavy rain events (115.6 mm to 204.5 mm) during July, while 205 stations witnessed extremely heavy rains (>204.5 mm). July began on a rainy note recovering deficit rainfall for several parts of the country but it was followed by extreme weather events, triggering a series of flash floods, landslides and mudslides.  Rains wreaked havoc across Himachal Pradesh, which reported over 50 landslides in just one week. Meanwhile, extremely heavy rainfall spells along the west coast over Gujarat, Maharashtra (including over Mumbai), Goa and Karnataka spanned for 10-long days from July 18-28.  Scientists claim that climate change has made monsoons more erratic and volatile, leading to frequent landslides and flash floods in India's Himalayan north.  ""The Himalayas have emerged as the hotspot for climate change. While last year it was Uttarakhand, this year it was Himachal Pradesh which is bearing the brunt of global warming. Himalayas act as a barrier, which confronts the moist winds coming from the Arabian Sea as well as the Bay of Bengal,"" said YP Sundriyal, Head, professor at department of geology at HNB Garhwal University in Uttarakhand.",How has climate change impacted monsoon patterns in India and what extreme weather events have been observed as a result?,"Climate change has caused alterations in monsoon patterns in India, leading to record-breaking extreme weather events.

1,"He pointed to a 2008 federal report about a fire in Lake Arrowhead, California, that found that a wildfire initially showered a neighborhood with fiery debris, igniting several homes and vegetation. But it was the subsequent spread between houses that accounted for most of the residential damage, the report said, not the wildfire itself engulfing homes. Photos in the report show homes destroyed amid trees that remain standing. Christopher Dunn, an Oregon State University assistant professor of wildfire risk science, also said the Maui images were not unusual, providing photos from a 2020 fire in southern Oregon in which homes were destroyed while neighboring trees remained upright, despite some charring. While small pieces of wood burn easily, the sheer size of large trees, some protection from their bark and the water they contain make it so they don't simply vaporize during a fire, he said, which explains the fact that some salvage trees for lumber after a forest fire. Arnaud Trouvé, a professor of fire protection engineering at the University of Maryland, noted that fires can spread through flame contact, radiation or the flying embers, also known as ""firebrands."" ""A fire that spreads through flame contact and/or radiation will typically attack all fuel sources on its path. Under those conditions, you would not expect to find unburnt trees,"" he said in an email. ""But fire spread in the wildland urban interface (WUI) has been shown to be often controlled by firebrands. Under those conditions, you can find patches of unburnt vegetation and structures. This has been observed in previous WUI fires on the West Coast of the US."" He added that structures, decks and fences are susceptible to accumulating flying embers, making them particularly vulnerable — whereas the wind may blow such embers past trees and poles.

Ms Davey said that many imported flowers are treated with chemicals in order to meet Australia's strict biosecurity measures.

Fast flowers, she said, present many of the same problems posed by fast fashion and fast food.

Brazil, home to the majority of the Amazon rainforest, will likely use its presidency to advocate for increased funds for environmental preservation, said Laerte Apolinário Júnior, a professor of international relations at the Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo.  Lula has sought to move beyond the disputes over Ukraine, telling Indian news site Firstpost that the G20 wasn't the appropriate forum to discuss the war.  Brazil has proposed mediating in the conflict, but those efforts have largely been rebuffed, and its refusal to arm Ukraine has sparked criticism from Western countries.  Latin America's biggest democracy is also scheduled to assume the presidency of the BRICS group — composed of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — and host the UN's climate conference in 2025.  In the months leading up to the leaders' summit in New Delhi, India had been unable to find agreement on the wording about Ukraine, with Russia and China objecting even to language that they had agreed to at the 2022 G20 summit in Bali.  This year's final statement, released a day before the formal close of the summit, highlighted the ""human suffering and negative added impacts of the war in Ukraine,"" but did not mention Russia's invasion directly.  Western leaders — who have pushed for a stronger rebuke of Russia's actions in past G20 meetings — still called the consensus a success, and praised India's nimble balancing act.  Oleg Nikolenko, spokesman for Ukraine's foreign ministry, said his government was grateful to the countries that tried to include strong wording, but that the ""G20 has nothing to be proud of,"" suggesting among other things that the war ""in Ukraine,"" should have been referred to as the war ""against Ukraine."". Though the Ukraine wording was not as strong as many Western leaders wanted, it could help bolster the West's position in the long run, said a senior EU official who only spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity to talk frankly about the discussions.",Why has Brazil's refusal to arm Ukraine sparked criticism from Western countries?,"Brazil's refusal to arm Ukraine has sparked criticism from Western countries because it is seen as not doing enough to support Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.

1,"G-20 Sherpas reach deal on wording for Russia war in Ukraine. The US and its allies sought stronger language to denounce Russia's aggression, while Moscow resisted and received support from China. The final statement is expected to refer to Russia's war ""in"" Ukraine, rather than ""against Ukraine."" Other sticking points include differing views on sanctions and defining a ""just peace"" for Ukraine. The language still needs to be approved by G-20 leaders.  Diplomats from the Group of 20 nations have hammered out compromise language on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, overcoming differences between Moscow and the rest of the group that had threatened to derail hopes of a joint communique from this weekend's summit.  The phrasing is broadly similar to that agreed at last year's summit in Bali, Indonesia, according to people familiar with the discussions. They asked not to be identified to describe internal deliberations.  The language still must be approved by G-20 leaders, but that's seen as likely now that senior staff have agreed on the language, they said.  The US and its allies had sought tougher phrasing to denounce what they see as Russia's aggression. Moscow had resisted, seeking to weaken the reference, and for a time enjoyed the support of China.  The final statement is expected to directly refer to Russia's war ""in"" Ukraine, rather than the ""against Ukraine"" phrasing that the US and its allies had sought. The other main sticking points centered on how to reflect different views on sanctions — some other G-20 members share Russia's opposition to them — and how to define a ""just peace"" for Ukraine.  Negotiations over the phrasing had run nearly around the clock in recent days and the preliminary agreement came as the leaders were beginning the formal G-20 sessions Saturday in New Delhi.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earlier singled out China for blocking efforts to achieve consensus, telling Bloomberg News on the plane to India that the talks in the run-up to the two-day summit had been ""challenging.""

1,"Giuliani liable for defaming Georgia election workers, judge rules. Trump's former lawyer will have to pay damages for spreading false claims that workers secretly processed and counted batches of illegal ballots. Donald Trump's former lawyer Rudy Giuliani is liable for defaming two Georgia election workers who were the target of vote-rigging conspiracy accusations following the 2020 US presidential election, a US judge in Washington ruled on Wednesday.  US district judge Beryl Howell issued the order as a sanction against Mr Giuliani for failing to turn over electronic records sought by the two Fulton County election workers, Wandrea ""Shaye"" Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, in the case.  The judge found that Mr Giuliani had refused to comply with a process for producing records, known as discovery, and rejected the former New York mayor's argument that the election workers had used the lawsuit to harass him.  ""Donning a cloak of victimisation may play well on a public stage to certain audiences, but in a court of law this performance has served only to subvert the normal process of discovery in a straightforward defamation case,"" the judge wrote in her order.  Lawyers for Mr Giuliani and the election workers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Ted Goodman, a political adviser to Mr Giuliani, called the ruling a ""prime example of the weaponisation of the justice system, where the process is the punishment"".  Mr Giuliani argued in court filings that he had sought to turn over records, but faced several obstacles, including having his phone seized by federal agents in 2021.  Mr Giuliani is also facing criminal charges in Georgia's Fulton County for allegedly aidingthen-president Donald Trump's effort to overturn his election loss in the state, including by making false claims about Ms Moss and Ms Freeman. Mr Giuliani has called that indictment a ""travesty"".  The judge's order means Mr Giuliani will have to pay damages for spreading false claims that Moss and Freeman secretly processed and counted batches of illegal ballots at a Georgia arena used to tabulate votes following the 2020 election. The pair said they received death threats and harassment after Mr Giuliani identified them by name and likened them to drug dealers.","What was the ruling against Rudy Giuliani in the defamation case brought by two Georgia election workers, and what were the judge's reasons for issuing the ruling?","Rudy Giuliani was ruled liable for defaming two Georgia election workers, Wandrea ""Shaye"" Moss and Ruby Freeman, by spreading false claims about their involvement in processing and counting illegal ballots during the 2020 US presidential election.

August 29th, 2023 ( https://www.ibtimes.com/?utm_source=lexisnexis&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=newstex  — Delivered by  https://newstex.com/?utm_source=lexisnexis&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=International+Business+Times+News&utm_id=108767&utm_content=IBTX-108767-169328376681425876100249 ). Air pollution is more dangerous to the health of the average person on planet Earth than smoking or alcohol, with the threat worsening in its global epicenter South Asia even as China fast improves, a study showed Tuesday.  Yet the level of funding set aside to confront the challenge is a fraction of the amount earmarked for fighting infectious diseases, said the research from the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC).  Its annual Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) report showed that fine particulate air pollution -- which comes from vehicle and industrial emissions, wildfires and more -- remains the ""greatest external threat to public health."". If the world were to permanently reduce these pollutants to meet the World Health Organization's (WHO) guideline limit, the average person would add 2.3 years onto his or her life expectancy, according to the data, which has a 2021 cutoff.  Fine particulate matter is linked to lung disease, heart disease, strokes and cancer.  Tobacco use, by comparison, reduces global life expectancy by 2.2 years while child and maternal malnutrition is responsible for a reduction of 1.6 years.  Asia and Africa bear the greatest burden yet have some of the weakest infrastructure to deliver citizens timely, accurate data. They also receive tiny slices of an already small global philanthropic pie.  For example, the entire continent of Africa receives less than $300,000 to tackle air pollution.  ""There is a profound disconnect with where air pollution is the worst and where we, collectively and globally, are deploying resources to fix the problem,"" Christa Hasenkopf, director of air quality programs at EPIC, told AFP.","According to the annual Air Quality Life Index report, what is the impact of permanently reducing fine particulate air pollution to meet the World Health Organization's guideline limit?","According to the annual Air Quality Life Index report, if the world were to permanently reduce fine particulate air pollution to meet the World Health Organization's guideline limit, the average person would add 2.3 years onto their life expectancy.

In February, pop singer Lizzo won the Grammy for record of the year for ""About Damn Time,"" her exuberant 2022 disco-funk single. Overjoyed at the honor, she took the stage at Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles and summed up what a triumph it was for larger women of color like her who long struggled to find a place in the entertainment industry.  ""Now I look around and there's all these songs that are about loving our bodies and feeling comfortable in our skin and feeling f-- good, and I'm just so proud to be a part of it,"" Lizzo, born Melissa Jefferson, said.  ""Anybody at home who feels misunderstood or on the outside looking in like I did, just stay true to yourself,"" she continued, ""I promise you, you will find people, you will attract people in your life who believe in you and support you."". Just six months after that high point in her career, Lizzo is now confronting allegations that threaten to undo years building a hard-won image as a beacon of empowerment and self-acceptance. A singer seen as an agent of change in the music industry has, for some, come to symbolize its entrenched problems.  Three of Lizzo's former backup dancers recently sued Lizzo and her company Big Grrrl Big Touring, alleging sexual harassment and creating a hostile work environment for the marginalized women she'd encouraged on the Grammy stage.  The claims include allegations of being pressured to touch dancers during a live nude performance in Amsterdam; racial, size and religious-based harassment; and one dancer being forced into an hours-long rehearsal until she soiled herself from exhaustion.

1,"How climate change boosts hurricanes. Warm waters provide the fuel that intensifies tropical storms and hurricanes. Washington: Scientists are sounding the alarm on human-caused climate change's impact on hurricanes such as Idalia, which rapidly intensified over a warm Gulf of Mexico before making landfall in Florida on Wednesday.  Here's what you need to know.  Record-warm oceans counter El Nino. Back in May, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted a ""near normal"" Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30.  That was in large part because of the El Nino global weather pattern, which causes a higher than average ""vertical wind shear"" in the Atlantic, which in turn suppresses hurricane activity.  ""If you have big changes in the wind with height, that tends to import dry, lower-energy air into the core of a tropical cyclone and prevent it from strengthening,"" Allison Wing, an atmospheric scientist at Florida State University, told AFP.  But come August, NOAA increased its forecast prediction for the season to ""above normal,"" based on ocean and atmospheric conditions ""such as record-warm Atlantic sea surface temperatures"" that ""are likely to counterbalance the usually limiting atmospheric conditions associated with the ongoing El Nino event."". ""It's been a sort of tricky year in terms of thinking about the whole seasonal forecast because we have these two opposing factors,"" said Wing.  What is known about climate change. One-eye catching example: on July 24 a buoy off the southern tip of Florida recorded an alarming peak temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit (38.4 Celsius), readings more commonly associated with hot tubs, and a possible new world record.  ""Warm waters, both at the surface of the ocean and beneath, provide the fuel that intensifies tropical storms and hurricanes,"" said Michael Mann, a climatologist at University of Pennsylvania. ""That allows them to both intensify faster and attain higher maximum intensities.""Warm waters provide the fuel that intensifies tropical storms and hurricanes. You still need the right conditions to lead to hurricane formation - but when they come along, storms will take advantage of warming oceans to generate fiercer winds and cause bigger storm surges.",What role does warm water play in intensifying hurricanes and tropical storms?,"Warm waters provide the fuel that intensifies tropical storms and hurricanes.

1,"Instead, the school simply installed a video security system equipped with analytics to detect when anyone was trying to scale the roof. When the activity was detected, an alert was sent immediately to security radios and staff responded right away, helping to deter acts of vandalism without breaking the bank.  2. Smart Analytics To Provide Actionable Insights. The ability to quickly identify and locate individuals on campus, whether it's students or unauthorized persons, is imperative for ensuring school safety. When an Indiana parent called her son's school to report that he didn't return home on the bus, the school jumped into action. In a search that would have traditionally taken hours, the school entered a description of the student's clothing into its AI video search engine, which immediately pulled footage of the student leaving school grounds in a red car. In describing the car to the parent, she immediately recognized that it was his brother picking him up from school. This entire chain of events took under three minutes, with the parent remaining on the phone with the school the entire time.  Schools are also utilizing license plate recognition technology, which expands security to the perimeter of school grounds. In the same Indiana school district, an employee was terminated and did not receive the news well. Fortunately, school security officers entered the employee's license plate information into the video system and less than an hour later, an alert was triggered when the employee was attempting to enter another facility on school grounds. Four officers responded to the alert immediately. With widened visibility, automatic alerts and useful data, schools are able to quickly detect suspicious activity and proactively mitigate threats.  3. Automating The Response For A Connected Campus. Mass notification technology can also ensure that the correct people are notified during an emergency, even if they're not on school grounds at the time. When a Mississippi elementary school hosted a back-to-school night for parents, one attendee had a medical emergency. Even though it was after school hours, a staff member activated the school's panic button to contact 9-1-1 and requested medical assistance at the incident's exact location.

Rescuers in central Greece are trying to reach hundreds of people trapped by floods that have left villages submerged and seven people dead.  Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said Greeks face ""a very unequal battle"" with nature.  Rivers have burst their banks and homes and bridges have been swept away after days of torrential rain.  Residents in villages around Palamas and Karditsa have appealed for food and water.  After weeks of scorching temperatures and wildfires, the plains of Thessaly have been deluged by a three-day storm.  Up to 800mm (31.5in) of rain fell in 24 hours - more than a year's worth of rainfall - inundating the flat terrain of Thessaly in central Greece.  There are fears the death toll could rise when rescuers are able to reach more of the flooded areas. The seventh victim of the floods to be found on Friday was a 69-year-old man in Volos.  Visiting some of the worst-affected areas, the Greek prime minister said the country was dealing with ""a natural phenomenon the likes of which we have never seen before"".  Crops have been devastated and satellite images have shown almost 73,000 sq m of land in Thessaly has been flooded.  Mr Mitsotakis promised to compensate people, whose houses had been destroyed or damaged, as quickly as possible.  ""We will do everything humanly possible. I understand both anger and rage. I never hid, I'm always here in difficult times,"" he said.  The rain has now largely stopped, but the floodwaters in some areas are in places greater than 2m (6.5ft) deep.

TOKYO/JAKARTA -- Last November, G20 leaders in Bali hailed what they said was a transformational climate change finance deal to help wean Indonesia off coal. Nine months on, not a single dollar of the $20 billion package has been spent on actively closing down fossil fuel projects. . As the northern hemisphere sweats out one of the planet's hottest-ever summers, and G20 leaders prepare to gather again in India this month, the project that was supposed to provide a breakthrough model in paving the way for the developed world to assist emerging countries to reduce carbon while their economies grow remains mired in meetings on operational details. . The investment plan to activate Indonesia's much-needed 'Just Energy Transition Partnership' (JETP) funding remains absent after negotiators missed a mid-August deadline. While the U.S. and Japan have led in securing political will and financing pledges, standing in the way are practical challenges: working out which targets qualify for investment, agreeing on private or public finance mechanisms to support them -- and bridging diverging views on loan repayment rates. . As the clock ticks, prospects for JETPs in other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, responsible for about half of global carbon emissions, remain distant. A $15.5 billion JETP for Vietnam agreed in December 2022 remains in the starting blocks, while a further JETP mooted for India -- the world's third-biggest carbon emitter -- is in its infancy. .

Musk argued repeatedly that he had avoided a nuclear war by thwarting the attack, believing that would have been Russia's response had it gone ahead.  He was under pressure after an outraged response from Ukrainian officials, who said Musk was responsible for the deaths Russia's ships had gone on to cause, and was trying to ""play god"" by intervening.  The attack, in September 2022, was with underwater drones strapped with explosives, and was aimed at the Russian navy in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula Russia has occupied since 2014.  The attack features in the forthcoming biography of Musk by the writer Walter Isaacson and became public knowledge Thursday when The Washington Post published an excerpt describing the details.  Per the excerpt, when Musk realized the attack was underway, he asked Starlink engineers to cut service within 100 kilometers of Crimea, meaning that as the drones approached they stopped working and drifted away. It said he feared the attack would be a ""mini Pearl Harbor."". Ukrainian officials soon hit back. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, wrote: ""By not allowing Ukrainian drones to destroy part of the Russian military fleet via Starlink interference, Elon Musk allowed this fleet to fire Kalibr missiles at Ukrainian cities. As a result, civilians, children are being killed."".","Why did Elon Musk refuse Ukraine access to his Starlink network for their attack on Russia's navy, and what were his reasons for believing that he prevented a nuclear war by doing so?","Elon Musk refused Ukraine access to his Starlink network for their attack on Russia's navy because he believed it would have escalated into a nuclear war.

1,"How CRE Owners Can Prepare To Recover From Climate-Related Emergencies. pm EDT|. As the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires continue to rise, it's more critical than ever that commercial real estate (CRE) owners and operators prepare by developing proactive, resilient climate-related emergency strategies.  While addressing climate change requires partnerships and coordinated action, front-end planning for severe weather and other climate-related emergencies can also benefit from outside experience and perspective, putting owners in a better position to reduce damage, bounce back quickly, protect their teams and tenants and potentially save lives when things go from bad to worse.  Conduct a site-specific risk assessment. Knowing how to respond in a climate emergency requires first understanding a property's unique characteristics and vulnerabilities—more specifically, the property type and location. After all, generic plans won't anticipate all the potential scenarios for both a 50-story office building with controlled access and a shopping mall that is designed to welcome in the general public. With different uses being present throughout properties, knowing how to manage each area is essential for creating a thorough emergency response plan.  Among the questions to consider: Is the property primarily an office, retail, industrial or medical facility? What secondary uses does the property have that may affect emergency response? What are the known direct geographical climate risks (hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, excessive heat or cold) and indirect impacts from ancillary locations (smoke, droughts, floods)?. Identifying the specific vulnerabilities of a property and its location allows owners to tailor an appropriate plan for when disaster strikes. This may involve incorporating measures such as flood barriers for properties located in flood-prone areas or wildfire prevention strategies for those in fire-prone regions, leveraging historical weather data and local climate projections to formulate an effective plan.  Develop a climate emergency response plan. After assessing the risks, property owners must develop a comprehensive plan that outlines the necessary steps before, during and after climate-related emergencies. The plan must encompass various scenarios, including evacuation procedures, communication protocols and resource allocation.",What are the benefits of conducting a site-specific risk assessment in preparing for climate-related emergencies in commercial real estate?,"Conducting a site-specific risk assessment in preparing for climate-related emergencies in commercial real estate provides several benefits.

A potential meeting between Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un appears to be fresh evidence that Moscow is looking to its short list of allies for help sustaining its war machine in Ukraine.  Is Russia running out of ammunition? It's a question Ukraine and its allies have been pondering as the war continues well into its second year.  Back in December, the US military estimated that, without outside help, Moscow would burn through its stocks of artillery shells and rockets by early this year - so why haven't they run out?. It's certainly true that, whatever supply issues it has encountered, Russia's war machine continues to rain down misery upon Ukraine's defenders.

COATES: Well, John Dean, on that point that the other Jon was talking about just now and the idea of the attorney-client privilege, it strikes me that we are only going to talk about just a mere fraction of the people who are also co-defendants, they are a total of 19 people.  And in the other cases we've seen against Donald Trump, whether it has been Mar-a-Lago or what's happening out of Washington, D.C., in the January 6th, as it's coined criminal indictment, I wonder with this growing web of people -- I mean, there's a yearbook photo really on the screen right now as we are conversing. Are you seeing parallels to Watergate in terms of just how many people in Trump's orbit are being pulled into this?. And by the way, people who we've known about, like a Sidney Powell or Mark Meadows and many other of these people, the names not, you know, household names to most people for any reason.  [23:25:05]. DEAN: Well, actually, the Watergate special prosecution force pared down the major trial in Watergate, the cover-up trial, in which Nixon was an unindicted co-conspirator. That helped get his tapes into evidence. But there, they had Haldeman, the chief-of-staff, Ehrlichman, the former top domestic advisor, Mitchell, the former attorney general, and some lesser lights. But it wasn't a packed courtroom. It wasn't 19. I think it was six or seven at one point. Some of them got severed and dropped later.  So, the process of litigating these things, sort them out, I don't believe 19 people are going to go to trial in this case.","Are there parallels between the number of people involved in Trump's legal cases and the Watergate scandal, and how does the number of co-defendants in Trump's cases compare to Watergate?","There are parallels between the number of people involved in Trump's legal cases and the Watergate scandal. In Watergate, the major cover-up trial had six or seven defendants at one point, including high-ranking officials like Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Mitchell. However, in Trump's cases, there are a total of 19 co-defendants.

Smith told The Washington Post that, already, officials have revised one proposal calling for the Marines' standard infantry battalion to shrink from 896 to 735 personnel, an attempt to make the units more nimble. The service now thinks 811 troops is the right size, Smith said, and could revise the figure again.  The prospective commandant also foresees the service scrutinizing lessons from Ukraine, noting that in a ""fairly stalemated war,"" the range of artillery matters a great deal and that troops who fail to hide their radio communications will come under fire.  Another priority that awaits: There is a dwindling number of warships to move troops at sea. For years, the Marine Corps said it needed 38, but the Navy has shrunk that number over time. The Marines now say they need at least 31, but the Navy has signaled it could cut even more. It's a significant concern, officials say, citing the scramble in April when the United States moved to evacuate its embassy in Sudan but had no Marines at sea nearby to assist.

Russia invaded Ukraine more than 18 months ago, launching a brutal war that still has no end in sight.  Coverage of the grueling conflict has, in part, been characterized by a litany of Russian military mistakes that began early and continue to crop up.  The country has nevertheless begun to learn from many of its early disastrous missteps, evidenced by its strategically sound defenses that have thus far curtailed Ukraine's current counter-offensive.  But even as they adapt, President Vladimir Putin's exhausted, poorly-motivated troops continue to make unforced errors.  Here are 5 military mistakes Russia has made since February 24, 2022.  Failure to take Kyiv. . Russia started the war with a massive failure right off the bat. Putin vowed Russian troops would take the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv within a matter of days. Eighteen months later the city has yet to fall.  Hindsight lays bare the obvious tactical mistakes that created a Russian logistical nightmare in Kyiv: The country failed to use its significant aviation assets to achieve air superiority early in the conflict; sent its military convoys into Ukrainian ambushes in and around the city; and failed to successfully deploy battalion tactical groups, sending tanks into the fight without infantry and infantry without tanks, Insider reported soon after the invasion.  Russia's lack of sufficient preparation was likely a consequence of what many experts believe to be the country's most costly mistake thus far — underestimating Ukraine.  Putin rushed his troops into a fight they were never trained for against a united force that had everything to lose, Michael Kofman, a Russia expert at the Center for Naval Analyses, noted in February 2024.",What are some of the costly mistakes that the Russian military has made since invading Ukraine in 2022?,"Some of the costly mistakes made by the Russian military since invading Ukraine in 2022 include:

2. Lack of sufficient preparation: Experts believe that underestimating Ukraine was a costly mistake. Russia rushed its troops into a fight they were untrained for and underestimated the united force they were up against.

And Evan, things got pretty contentious during this hearing when the judge and the prosecutors and the defense attorneys were trying to discuss the trial date.  EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Jake. John Lauro, one of the former president's attorneys, really took offense to the push by prosecutors to try to bring this case, to try to get this to trial as early as January of 2024. He called that request absurd and ridiculous. And he said that what prosecutors were trying to get was a show trial, not a fair trial.  The judge immediately pushed back. Judge Tanya Chutkan said, okay, let's take the temperature down. And she went through methodically all of the time that the former president's lawyers have really had to prepare for a trial. And that's why in the end she said there was a public interest in having a prompt resolution of this case and why she set a date of March 4th, which, as you pointed out, is one day before the Super Tuesday primaries.  Now, what this means, Jake, is that, you know, after that primary, the former president is going to spend a lot of time in court. The prosecution has said that their case is going to take four to five -- four to six weeks to present, which means that the former president is not going to be able to be out campaigning.

1,"Of course, other counter activities can be considered, such as using renewable energy as a source of energy to replace fossil fuel consumption.  Despite the availability of virtual meetings, successful training and rich experience that global citizens have had during the Corona pandemic, NGOs often justify physical presence in meetings as essential for building relationships and fostering impactful discussions on eye-to-eye basis. However convincing that might be, it is essential to strike a balance between the necessity of face-to-face interaction and the imperative to reduce carbon emissions has become paramount in our warming world. This urge comes amidst fears of not meeting the 1.5º-2.0ºC limit of increase in average atmospheric temperature by 2050, compared to the level of the pre-industrial revolution.  Similarly, the choice of accommodations during local activities and international gatherings is another aspect that merits scrutiny. Opting for five stars hotels not only contributes to excessive resource consumption but also sends a mixed signal about an NGO's commitment to sustainability. While some NGOs might argue that posh hotels facilitate productive interactions and networking opportunities, yet the negative environmental impact must not be ignored. Exploring alternatives, such as renting eco-friendly lodgings, choosing venues for meeting spaces at local NGO's available spaces and renting main offices in the less privileged towns rather than crowded capitals, consequently these activities can assist in distributing wealth more justly around the country and allow environmental activities to be more closely aligned with the sponsor's mission.  The difference between carbon emissions using a five-star hotel and a three-star hotel can be shocking, considering energy, water and food offered. Therefore, to address this carbon footprint dilemma, NGOs can take several proactive measures. Firstly, embracing intelligent technology for virtual meetings and conferences, whenever feasible, can significantly reduce travel-related emissions.

1,"What about kids with asthma? Are they at greater risk?. Yes. Hotter weather and humidity can both increase the risk of asthma attacks. A 2016 study published in Environmental Health found that extreme heat, particularly during the summer, increased risks of asthma-related hospitalizations. Heat and humidity can constrict airways, making it harder for asthmatic people to breathe, according to the Asthma and Allergy Network.  People with asthma are already more vulnerable to health-related issues during the month of September, when the presence of ragweed pollen and other triggers increase, according to Kay.  Asthma prevalence in Massachusetts is among the highest reported across US states, according to the state Department of Public Health, and Boston bears a disproportionate burden.  During the 2011-2012 school year, nearly 16 percent of K-8 students in Boston had asthma, higher than the statewide average of 11.9 percent, according to a report from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.  The report also found that children in Boston have higher rates of hospitalizations and emergency department visits due to asthma than in the rest of the state.  Rates are higher among Black and Hispanic children. According to the state health department, Black children are more than 5 times as likely as white children to have asthma, and Hispanic children are more than 3.7 times more likely.  How can I help my child deal with the heat?. Make sure students are drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day, especially before playing sports or other physical activity.  Their clothes can make a difference, too. Kay recommends picking light-colored fabrics that deflect heat and loose-fitting clothes on hot days. Breathable fabrics are also helpful as they allow sweat to evaporate, cooling down the child's body, according to the EPA.  Is there a way to check how hot my child's school is?. Boston Public Schools operates an online air quality dashboard to help identify and respond to air quality and temperature issues. The dashboard allows anyone to check the temperature, relative humidity, carbon monoxide, and other air quality metrics for all BPS schools.  Globe correspondent Maggie Scales contributed reporting.","According to the excerpt, what are some ways parents can help their children deal with the effects of hot weather on asthma?","According to the information in the excerpt, parents can help their children with asthma deal with the effects of hot weather by taking the following measures: ensuring their child drinks plenty of fluids throughout the day, especially before physical activity; dressing their child in light-colored and loose-fitting clothes made of breathable fabrics that allow sweat to evaporate and cool down the body; and checking the temperature and air quality of their child's school using the online air quality dashboard provided by Boston Public Schools.

He had made a grand visit to the US in December last year and delivered an address to the US House of Representatives.

""Vietnam will become an increasingly important link in the global supply chain,"" said Le Hong Hiep, a senior fellow in Vietnam studies at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.  Washington, which lifted a ban on arms sales to Vietnam in 2016, also considers it a promising market for weapons and military equipment as Hanoi tries to reduce its reliance on Moscow.  Strategically, experts say, the U.S. sees Vietnam as an important partner in its effort to counter the rise of China, particularly its expansive claims in the South China Sea, a resource-rich waterway through which trillions of dollars in trade flows each year.  Matthew Pottinger, who served as deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration, said that Biden's quick trip to Hanoi is undoubtedly intended as a signal to Beijing.

That bleak outcome is largely because China and the US are ""increasingly paranoid about the other's intentions,"" Roubini said, and both are making political tensions worse by attempting to strengthen their defenses.  Tensions between the two nations have been growing after US politicians signaled support for Taiwan in late 2022. The US has also taken steps moves to distance its own economy from China's.  China has suggested it could retaliate if its firms continue to face harsh treatment in the US, and updated its anti-espionage laws earlier this year to increase oversight over foreign businesses.

The BRICS countries should send out the strongest voice for all EMDEs during the 15th BRICS Summit and the upcoming 18th G20 Summit in September urging global development to be brought back on track and the improvement of the global economic governance system.  The core concepts of the Global Development Initiative and the Belt and Road Initiative could be incorporated into the G20 and the BRICS development agendas.",How are the BRICS countries working to increase development finance and prioritize poverty reduction in multilateral development banks?,"The BRICS countries are working to increase development finance and prioritize poverty reduction in multilateral development banks through several measures. First, they aim to enhance the representation and voice of emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) in institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). They also advocate for the G20 to establish an expert group on strengthening multilateral development banks and explore ways to expand their resources.

Additionally, the BRICS countries have called on all multilateral development banks to prioritize poverty reduction and inclusive growth projects, in response to the World Bank's tendency to downplay these goals. The New Development Bank, initiated by BRICS, specifically focuses on providing effective financing solutions for sustainable development in EMDEs.

The BRICS countries also emphasize infrastructure cooperation and innovation in financing models, such as mobilizing private finance to build inclusive and sustainable cities. They aim to strengthen the momentum of global development and improve global economic governance by fostering a sense of shared future, promoting openness, inclusiveness, and win-win cooperation.

The BRICS countries will use platforms like the G20 and the upcoming 15th BRICS Summit to advocate for bringing global development back on track and improving the global economic governance system, sending a strong voice for all EMDEs. Overall, their goal is to promote global development that is inclusive, beneficial to all, and resilient, incorporating core concepts from initiatives like the Global Development Initiative and the Belt and Road Initiative into their agendas. The evidence for these initiatives can be found in the excerpt where it states that the BRICS countries are jointly pushing for the reform of international financial institutions to increase development finance and are calling on multilateral development banks to prioritize poverty reduction and inclusive growth projects.",4d00c86ed673ec9486e78e593ff5f8af

The Republican presidential debate held on Aug. 6, 2015, was, at that point, the highest-rated broadcast in Fox News history and, with nearly 24 million viewers, ""among the most-viewed events in cable TV history,"" according to The New York Times.  Those nearly 24 million viewers represented about 7.5 times as many viewers who watched the first GOP debate of the 2011 election cycle. Not surprisingly, Trump, who many people assumed had no prayer of winning at the time, drove the higher viewership.  The same candidate will likely be the reason for lower viewership tonight. Not only is he declining to participate in tonight's Republican battle royale, but he's also determined to upstage the event with his pre-taped interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.  Zeeshan Aleem. Tonight is a pivotal moment for Ramaswamy, whose rise to third place in a number of national polls is probably the most surprising political success story of the GOP presidential primaries so far.  Despite having no political experience and brandishing an unabashedly elitist identity on the campaign trail, the entrepreneur has been able to win a respectable following through his smooth rhetorical delivery and his ease of debating ideological opponents.  If there's anywhere Ramaswamy can take his name recognition to the next level, it's a debate. And with Fox News seeming to embrace him more and more by the day, he's got the wind at his back tonight.  James Downie. If this debate were held a year ago, it's likely at least half of the debate — or more — would have been spent discussing rising prices. In June 2022, year-over-year inflation peaked at 9.1%, and the GOP was eagerly blaming Biden. (Never mind that other countries with different policies suffered inflation as well, or that more evidence pointed toward Russia's invasion of Ukraine and corporate greed.)",What is the significance of Ramaswamy's rise to third place in national polls in the GOP presidential primaries?,"The significance of Ramaswamy's rise to third place in national polls in the GOP presidential primaries is that it represents a surprising political success story. Despite having no political experience and presenting himself as unabashedly elitist, Ramaswamy has garnered a respectable following through his smooth rhetorical delivery and skill in debating ideological opponents.

Per the latest Edelman Trust Barometer, 93 percent say younger co-workers have influenced their views on things like work-life balance, and new technology. People are also expecting more out of their companies. Employees say they're more likely to work for firms that speak out on social issues. Eighty percent also expect personal empowerment from their workplaces.  Richard Edelman is the CEO of Edelman, the company behind the Trust Barometer, he joins me now. So great to have you with us.  RICHARD EDELMAN, CEO, EDELMAN: Thank you.  GIOKOS: Look, Gen Z is pushing for more meaningful work and this work- life balance. Full disclosure, I'm a millennial, but I'm closer to the previous generation. Work-life balance doesn't really exist in my life, but it is fascinating to see what younger employees are pushing for.  Give me a sense of what they're thinking and why they are actually -- they have, you know, the strength and I guess, the gravitas to be able to go to the employer and say, look, we want more out of life and this is what we want from you.  EDELMAN: So as we come to Labor Day in the US, what you see is that you have Gen Z being belief driven buyers of products, and also values driven employees. And since there's such low unemployment, they get to control their relationship with their employer. And they get to say, look, you're the most trusted institution, my employer trust is local. But we, in return, expect to have a voice in decisions. We want to have an employer who actually is making change in the world, and we want you as CEO to speak up on our behalf.","According to the latest Edelman Trust Barometer, what are some expectations that employees have for their companies?

Whether Biden really means that – and whether US leaders plan to permanently keep Taiwan out of China's reach – are believed to be focal points of some of China's intelligence efforts.  Without real intelligence on intentions, US and Chinese officials are focused on gathering information on each other's military capabilities. The US, for instance, has stepped up its aerial surveillance of Chinese military bases. Meanwhile, Chinese intelligence agents have penetrated many parts of the Taiwanese government over the decades, former US intelligence officials say.  Chinese agents are now trying to learn more about the Biden administration's efforts to outfit Taiwan with certain weapons systems and provide secret training for Taiwanese troops. Chinese agents also seek more details on the growing military cooperation between the US and Asian allies.

And it was all because of what we called Storm Daniel. It took on a medication which is like a hurricane in the Mediterranean type characteristics as it plowed into the eastern sections of Libya.  And you can see the rainfall totals here were very impressive. Derna saw upwards of 240 millimeters, but just to the west of that an area called El- Bayda that received 414 millimeters just in a 24 hour period and that is a record for that location.

7,"In order to promote the sustained and in-depth development of China-Latin America agricultural cooperation and jointly shape the resilience of cooperation, both sides should continue to make joint efforts in the following two aspects:. First, they should further highlight the ""agriculture+"" cooperation model to tap the potential of agricultural cooperation. Facing changes in the international environment, more possibilities for cooperation have emerged in China-Latin America agricultural cooperation. For example, after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, global fertilizer prices rose sharply, resulting in increased agricultural production costs. Brazil, Argentina and other countries are important importers of fertilizers, and have a high dependence on imports. If China and Latin America can explore further cooperation in this field, both sides will benefit. Brazil, Argentina and other countries have been affected by climate change. If China and Latin America can deepen cooperative research in the field of climate change, both sides will benefit.  At the second China-Latin America and Caribbean Agricultural Ministers' Forum, China announced that it would strive to bring total trade in agricultural products between China and Latin America to more than $100 billion by 2030. As long as the two sides work intensively, there is still huge potential for agricultural cooperation between China and Latin America, and it can lead to cooperation in more fields.  Second, the two sides should also continue to improve the institutional construction for China-Latin America agricultural cooperation and deepen the exchange of governance experience in the agricultural field. Policy communication is an important guarantee for the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, and institutional construction and top-level design are crucial for good policy coordination. Currently, the China-Latin America and Caribbean Agricultural Ministers' Forum has become an important platform for both sides to comprehensively deepen mutually beneficial agricultural cooperation. China has also established agricultural cooperation mechanisms with most Latin American countries. China has also put forward the Global Development Initiative and set up the China-LAC Cooperation Fund. How to make better use of these cooperation mechanisms and clarify their positioning is essential to further deepening China-Latin America agricultural cooperation. China and Latin America share similar goals in green agricultural development, food security and increase of farmers' income, and are exploring their own distinctive paths of agricultural modernization.","What are the two areas of focus for promoting China-Latin America agricultural cooperation, as outlined in the excerpt?","The two areas of focus for promoting China-Latin America agricultural cooperation, as outlined in the excerpt, are:

1.

7,"But this is not Rahul's first food rodeo. A few months earlier, he hopped from one favourite Delhi haunt to another with food host Kunal Vijaykar and before that, he shared meals with fisherfolk. ""Rahul is trying to build a working-class image and connecting with people through food,"" says food writer Vikram Doctor.  In April, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was found slapping dosas on a sizzling tawa at a Mysuru hotel during the Karnataka assembly election campaign. While campaigning for her brother at Amethi in 2014, author of 'Sonia: A Biography', Rasheed Kidwai recalls how Priyanka coaxed an old man to serve some of the jalebis that he was frying. ""The dessert was a magnet for flies but she asked the halwai, 'Chacha hume jalebi nahi  khilaoge?' (Uncle, won't you feed us jalebi) He was so happy. It was an immediate connect."" This was a bid to project a more approachable image for the Gandhis who are often criticised for being distant and protected, says Kidwai.  In this age of hyper messaging, the medium is often the message itself. In February 2020, PM Modi bit into a litti-chokha and posed with Muslim artisans to sound the bugle for the Bihar assembly polls. > MAHATMA'S MEAL >Doctor credits Mahatma Gandhi with pioneering the art of symbolism through his lifestyle, food and his public demeanour. At a meeting with Lord Irwin to discuss the release of prisoners in 1931, Mirabehn (Gandhi's English assistant Madeleine Slade) asked permission to serve him food as it was near his lunch time. Gandhi ate dates and goat's milk yogurt. When Irwin asked him what he was eating, he said this is ""Prophet's food.""

The meeting resulted in the Gandhi-Irwin pact.",How has Rahul Gandhi been using food to connect with people and build a working-class image?,"Rahul Gandhi has been using food to connect with people and build a working-class image by participating in various food-related activities.

7,"'Barbie' is being censored. The film's rollout in the Arab world hits a snag. BEIRUT — . The plan for the ""Barbie"" movie's debut across the Arab world was to go big. Anticipating a deluge of moviegoers, promoters prepped pink popcorn boxes, pink slushy drinks, a human-sized Barbie-toy box and even pink abayas for female fans in Saudi Arabia.  Then came the delays.  ""We were told we had to postpone opening, but no one knew why,"" said Anis Tabet, a Beirut-based film critic and promoter.  The movie, which opened globally in July and has raked in $1.34 billion at the box office, was the latest targeted by the region's censors. There was no official reason given for delays, but many speculated they were so cuts could be negotiated. ""Barbie"" opened in August in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan and Bahrain. (Any alterations were not immediately apparent, and Warner Bros. had no comment about the delays.). But the movie has been banned in Kuwait and Oman and pulled from theaters after a brief run in Algeria. It's still unclear whether it will show in Qatar or Lebanon.  If one of the primary marks of today's movies and politics is the culture wars over identity and orientation, Barbieland is a major battlefield. In the U.S., right-wing figures accuse ""Barbie"" of being ""woke"" and anti-man, while others insist it doesn't go far enough on the feminist front.  The Arab world too has joined the frenzy of hot takes — including national censorship boards, whose decisions on whether films can run often serve as bellwethers for how liberal or conservative a country has become.  Movies have long been chopped up to excise explicit scenes, sometimes including kissing, or on political or religious grounds. Some Arab countries refused to screen ""Wonder Woman"" or any other movie featuring the Israeli actress Gal Gadot, and in 2018, Christian groups got the horror movie ""The Nun"" banned in Lebanon.","Why has the ""Barbie"" movie faced delays and bans in certain countries in the Arab world?","The ""Barbie"" movie faced delays and bans in certain countries in the Arab world due to censorship by the region's censors. While no official reason was given for the delays, it is speculated that they were implemented to negotiate cuts to the film.

7,"Upgraded versions are said to have a limited ""hunter-killer"" capability, but lack the panoramic sight enjoyed by the commander in newer tanks. Like other models on this list, most T-72s are also fitted with a laser rangefinder, which adjusts the main gun before it fires in order to account for wind, temperature and the tank's movement.  As the Red Army's main tank until the Soviet Union's collapse, tens of thousands of these lightweight and relatively agile models are believed to have been produced, with Wired reporting in 2015 that used models could be bought by civilians for just $50,000.  These are the main tanks currently used by Ukraine, which also uses Soviet T-64s and T-80s, and as of March accounted for most of the 450 tanks Kyiv had been supplied with by its allies since Russia's invasion last February, given its existing familiarity with the vehicles.  But in terms of its armour, the T-72 is quite ""light"", mainly using welded steel, meaning that the crew protection element ""is certainly much weaker than other tanks"", according to Dr Miron – evidenced by the continual flow of images showing these tanks with their turrets blown off.

7,"Issa Rae may have been president in ""Barbie,"" but there still has never been a real-life woman in the Oval Office.  Women remain poorer than men, and have just seen our most fundamental rights to our own bodies stripped away - a move virtually guaranteed to leave scores of women poorer, physically injured, tied to abusive men and raising children who will have worse outcomes. Some will die.  But each time a wave of backlash crashes into us, women stand up and fight back. After a conservative Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the era of legal abortion across the United States, women sued, women put abortion rights on the ballot (and won every time), women organized to get abortion pills into conservative states and women (and those who care about them) went to the polls and undercut what should have been a Republican sweep in the midterm elections.  And then we clamored for music, movies, television and other pop culture expressions of our rage, our sadness, our joy, our power, our vulnerability, our desire for fun and our explicit feminism. Importantly, we gravitated toward connection in a post-pandemic moment-heading to concerts and the movies with groups of girlfriends, perhaps understanding intuitively that there is something about collective joyful experience that buoys us in difficult times.  I hope it lasts, that this more-feminist girl-culture moment grows into something bigger and stronger. History suggests it will be hit with the same reactionary backlash that has kneecapped so much feminist progress. But still: Even the steps back often come after sprints forward. And this summer, at least in the cultural realm, has felt like a deliriously fun dash.         .              Opinion by Jill Filipovic         .

Jason Aldean's song ""Try That in a Small Town"" also topped the Hot 100 after it became the subject of political controversy. Some on the left said its lyrics glorify gun violence and its video evokes racist imagery, particularly because of its setting at the Maury County Courthouse in Columbia, Tennessee, which was the site of a lynching in 1927 and a race riot in 1946.

7,"But instead of going through that arduous, lengthy, legal process, many simply have decided it would be simpler to pay cartels to help them cross the border illegally, present themselves as asylum-seekers, and slip into the country while their cases are being adjudicated. According to the Homeland Security inspector general, in just one 17- month period between March 2021 and August 2022, the federal government released more than one million migrants into the U.S. and immediately lost track of over 177,000 of them who had failed to give an address or had provided an invalid one.  [10:05:17]. When the system of due process collapses, as it has, it is most unfair to those who have legitimate claims to asylum or legal immigrant status. There is only one solution to this crisis. President Biden should either ask Congress for authority or use existing executive authority to suspend entirely the admission of asylum-seekers while the system digests the millions of immigration cases already pending.  The British government has passed a law to this effect. Other Western countries will undoubtedly follow. The world has changed. According to the U.N. High Commission for Refugees there are more than 40 million refugees and asylum-seekers globally. We need entirely new laws, standards, courts and systems so that asylum can be granted but through some orderly rational process rather than just leaving it up to officials in countries that are overwhelmed by legal entrants at their borders.  The migrant crisis is exposing Democratic policy weakness at every level. From an administration that is scared to take on its progressive wing and take bold action to states like New York and Massachusetts that have right to shelter rules that are utterly unworkable in the face of this onslaught. Unless Democrats seize control of this issue, the politics of it will end up having the same effect as in other Western countries. Rocket fuel for the populist right.  Donald Trump's main solution to this problem just didn't work.

John McCain , the late Arizona  Senator and 2008 GOP presidential candidate, sounded the alarm about Russia for years, making him one of President Vladimir Putin 's ""greatest antagonists,"" the Arizona Republic noted in February 2022, days after the Russian invasion began.  During the last year of his presidency in 2008, George W Bush said he ""strongly supported"" eventual Nato membership for Ukraine and Georgia. Last year, in a viral gaffe, he mistakenly said Iraq when he meant to call the war in Ukraine ""unjustified and brutal"".  His younger brother, Jeb Bush, a former Florida Governor, went to Europe in 2015 shortly before announcing his presidential campaign.  In a speech in Berlin about a year after Russia's annexation of Crimea and support of separatists in eastern Ukraine, he said: ""Russia must respect the sovereignty of all of its neighbours. And who can doubt that Russia will do what it pleases if aggression goes unanswered?"".

7,"The answer to both queries was a resounding ""yes"".  Collaborating with Polygeist from its Vivace community, ACE developed a Long Stay Stratification Tool powered by AI. This tool was trained on a vast dataset of 460,000 anonymised patient records, allowing it to identify potential long-stayers based on initial patient data.  The result of this collaboration was the creation of an instant long stayer risk score, accessible to all reception and clinical staff. Armed with this information, healthcare providers could make informed decisions to mitigate known risk factors.  For example, if a doctor suspects a patient is at a higher risk of becoming a long-stayer, they may opt for alternative treatments, ward assignments, or prompt referrals to geriatricians or physiotherapists to prevent patient decline.  In an impressive feat, ACE delivered the PoC within a mere 12 weeks. The tool received enthusiastic feedback from Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the broader NHS community.  It successfully identified 66 per cent of long stayers within the highest risk categories. This achievement holds both substantial health and economic benefits, as a single-day reduction in the average hospital stay yields £1.7 million in savings for Gloucester Hospitals alone.  Following the PoC's success, it was transitioned into a limited closed Alpha service phase, where it was seamlessly integrated with the trust's electronic health record system through application programming interfaces (APIs). This integration enabled further testing using datasets from the COVID-19 era, where the tool's accuracy remained consistently high.  In addition to the recent breakthrough in utilising AI to predict and prevent prolonged hospital stays, the UK government is taking a bold step to sustain and enhance the nation's life sciences workforce. On Tuesday, September 5th, the government announced a £5.5 million investment to establish a Medicines Manufacturing Skills Centre of Excellence.

7,"UN warns thousands trafficked into online crime in SE Asia. Hundreds of thousands of people are being coerced in Southeast Asia by criminal gangs into carrying out online scams, often under the threat of torture, the United Nations said Tuesday.   Many have been trafficked into working in online criminality and face serious violations such as torture or sexual violence, the UN said in a report. ""People who are coerced into working in these scamming operations endure inhumane treatment while being forced to carry out crimes,"" UN human rights chief Volker Turk said. ""They are victims. They are not criminals."" The scale of the scourge in Southeast Asia is difficult to gauge because of the practice's clandestine nature and gaps in the response by authorities, the report noted. However, it said that credible sources indicated that at least 120,000 people across Myanmar may be held in situations where they are forced to carry out online scams. Estimates in Cambodia are at around 100,000, it added. Laos, the Philippines and Thailand are among other nations in the region identified as the main countries of destination or transit. The scam centres generate revenue amounting to billions of dollars a year, the UN said. Victims come from across the ASEAN region, mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Asia and further afield from Africa and Latin America. Most people trafficked into the online scam operations are men, although women and teens are also victims, the report said. The illicit networks benefited from the Covid pandemic, which in some countries saw casinos closed under public health measures. This led to casino operators moving to less regulated spaces, including conflict-affected border areas, and online, the report said. The Covid crisis also left many migrants more vulnerable, stranded in countries and out of work due to border and business closures. Lockdowns also saw people spending more time online and susceptible to becoming targets of online fraud, the report said.

One of Donald Trump's co-defendants, Kenneth Chesebro, asked for a speedy trial on Georgia racketeering charges before the next election. Fulton County Attorney Fani Willis offered to start the trial two months after the indictment, on Oct. 23.  Trump has proposed to delay his other pending criminal trials until after the 2024 presidential election. Willis had proposed to start her trial March 4, although Trump and the judge haven't responded yet.  Chesebro is a lawyer who allegedly developed the strategy to have Vice President Mike Pence reject the state's presidential electors when Congress counted them Jan. 6, 2021. In addition to racketeering, Chesebro is charged with six conspiracy counts related to recruiting fake electors to support Trump in the state President Joe Biden won.  Chesebro's lawyers, Scott Grubman and Manubir Arora, said a speedy trial should start the first Monday of January, March, May, July, September or November.  Willis offered to start even faster, in the next term after the current grand jury term, on Oct. 23.  – Bart Jansen. Why wasn't Donald Trump at the debate?. Donald Trump didn't skip the first Republican debate in Milwaukee on Wednesday over his booking in Georgia or any of the other charges against him.

Frustration mounting, the secretaries of the Navy, Air Force and Army wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post this week saying Tuberville's efforts were not only unfair to the military leaders and their families but also ""putting our national security at risk."". They noted that three military branches — the Army, Navy and Marine Corps — have no Senate-confirmed chiefs in place. Those jobs are being performed without the full range of legal authorities necessary to make decisions that will sustain the U.S.'s military edge, they wrote.  ___. Greek shipper pleads guilty to smuggling Iranian crude oil and will pay $2.4 million fine. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A Greek shipping company has pleaded guilty to smuggling sanctioned Iranian crude oil and agreed to pay a $2.4 million fine, newly unsealed U.S. court documents seen Thursday by The Associated Press show.  The now-public case against Empire Navigation, which faces three years of probation under the plea agreement, marks the first public acknowledgement by U.S. prosecutors that America seized some 1 million barrels of oil from the tanker Suez Rajan. . The saga surrounding the ship further escalated tensions between Washington and Iran, even as they work toward a trade of billions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets in South Korea for the release of five Iranian Americans held in Tehran. The court filings also shed light on the covert world of Iranian crude oil smuggling in the face of Western sanctions since the collapse of its 2015 nuclear deal — an operation that has only grown in scale over this year. . The U.S. and its allies have been seizing Iranian oil cargoes since 2019. That's led to a series of attacks in the Mideast attributed to the Islamic Republic, as well as ship seizures by Iranian military and paramilitary forces that threaten global shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of the world's oil passes. .","What are the consequences of Tuberville's efforts to delay Senate approval for military promotions, according to the secretaries of the Navy, Air Force, and Army?","According to the Secretaries of the Navy, Air Force, and Army, Tuberville's efforts to delay Senate approval for military promotions are not only unfair to military leaders and their families, but they are also ""putting our national security at risk.""

A judge set a case date for Chesbro in October, and so it remains to be seen what that means for the rest of the defendants.  [05:10:07]. Now, another issue here is whether this case is kept in state court or moved into federal court. We've seen five of the 19 defendants have made a request to move their case into federal court.

7,"I'm sure you, dear reader, have not taken credit for a colleague's creativity, but I imagine you might know someone who has.  Oscar Wilde's assumption that life imitates art might need a rethink. Right now, it looks like the other way around.  Away from the office, contemporary fiction also serves up compelling drama about a very different work experience. In Barbara Kingsolver's Pulitzer-prize-winning novel , it's Walmart and the cold realities of shelf-stacking in supermarkets - monotonous, low-paid work - which feature in the lives of characters in a coal mining community, which has fallen victim to economic hard times and America's opioid crisis.  It isn't just literary fiction which tells this story of unfair work, or not enough work, or shift work. Billy Joel performed , a song about the decline of the manufacturing sector during the last century and the feeling that working life was a series of broken promises at his sellout gigs at Madison Square Garden and London's Hyde Park forty years after he first wrote the song.  In this respect, art does imitate life. Work's themes are either eternal or cyclical.  Hard times and hustle culture crop up a lot in a slew of non-fiction books explaining work culture and history. In , Derek Thompson writes that ""today the norm is to think about employment and unemployment as a black-and-white binary, rather than two points at opposite ends of a wide spectrum of working arrangements."". This point is echoed in by Sanjay Rishi, Benjamin Breslau and Peter Miscovich, executives with the real estate property company JLL. The book predicts a future where work becomes ""liquid,"" noting that ""employers and managers now need to view their workforces in terms of both employees and non-employees, which presents a challenge to creating a cohesive and integrated workplace ecosystem."". The last word goes to a recent futuristic Danish novel, , a sci-fi book set on a spaceship ""some time in the future,"" in which ""someone touched me on the shoulder and I saw that it was a humanoid co-worker."". Perhaps Oscar Wilde was prescient for our times. Pretty soon life will imitate art and the distinction between the humans and humanoids will echo some of sci-fi's outer realms.",What are some examples of literary and musical works that highlight the challenges and realities of work?,"Some examples of literary and musical works that highlight the challenges and realities of work include Barbara Kingsolver's Pulitzer-prize-winning novel, which explores the monotonous and low-paid work of shelf-stacking in Walmart amidst economic hardships and opioid crisis in a coal mining community.

7,"For small-and-medium-sized enterprises, it might drive them to value and develop the talents of their existing staff.  But we must try to remember the non-economic arguments for all this reform. I've always loved that Oscar Wilde quote: ""The trouble with socialism is that it takes too many evenings."" If, after chores, our afternoons and weekends truly open up, then might we have a flourishing amongst ourselves as active citizens, as much as workers/consumers?. We need to be subtle here. In the time we wrest from the maw of our economic lives, no-one (and no institution) should be prescribing ""socially and civically useful labour"". But maybe something like it may arise and emerge, if we are invited into conviviality.  This thought came to me when reading my colleague Stuart Cosgrove's recent column in these pages. It was about how the Scottish Government's target of ""every day of the year there's a festival"" was revitalising communities across the country, as they rose to its challenge.  The enlivening was economic and institutional, as well as cultural, reported Stuart. That is, it wasn't just selecting authors or artists, but developing skills of organising, project-managing, promotion, caring for visitors, etc.  The festival/carnival as not just ""nice to have"", but as a way of strengthening the coherence and capacity of communities, could be extended to other areas. Ones that are fringed with real crises.  For example, what about the need to localise food supply chains in Scotland, well in advance of the inevitable food disruptions that will come from global warming?. Somewhat regretfully, I'd have to say the ball was dropped here in Scotland. Over a decade ago, Mike Small from Bella Caledonia was advocating the ""Fife Diet"" on exactly this basis. Couldn't we revive such a call, for people to creatively build their own regional ""diets"", both in gastronomy and infrastructure?. It may seem impetuous to suggest this. But even a three-day week could become increasingly justifiable, as we reckon with the megatrends of both AI-led automation and hard climate limits.","How can festivals and community events contribute to the strengthening of communities and address local crises, such as the need to localize food supply chains in Scotland?","Festivals and community events can contribute to the strengthening of communities and address local crises by providing opportunities for skill development and collaboration. As mentioned in the excerpt, festivals in Scotland have revitalized communities by not only focusing on selecting authors or artists but also developing skills in organizing, project management, promotion, and caring for visitors. This approach can be extended to other areas, such as localizing food supply chains, by encouraging people to creatively build their own regional diets and infrastructure.

Morgenthau brought Trump on to the board of the Police Athletic Association, hosted a tribute dinner to him and accepted campaign contributions. He never opened a single investigation into Trump, and always felt there was nothing to see.  Soon after Rudy Giuliani was appointed the US attorney for the southern district in 1983, Trump was bounced out of New York by the bankers. Trump's profligacy and mismanagement crashed his monumental casino and hotel, the Taj Mahal in New Jersey, built with mob help, and he could not secure his loans. Giuliani was busy elsewhere, prosecuting the five families of the mafia, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico) of 1970, the first time the act was applied in a major case. His pioneering use of the Rico statute made Giuliani's reputation. Trump and Giuliani circled each other in a strange dance of outsized egos.  Giuliani threw in with Trump late in the game, during the 2016 campaign, when he manipulated his network of FBI agents in and around the New York office to raise the pressure on director James Comey to reopen the already closed investigation into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's emails because of the existence of a computer owned by her aide Huma Abedin and accessed by her husband Anthony Weiner. Comey succumbed. His public announcements were decisive in shifting marginal votes in swing states to Trump. (The FBI chief of counter-intelligence in the New York office at the time, Charles McGonigal, closely connected to Giuliani, pleaded guilty this week to money-laundering payments from a sanctioned Russian oligarch.).",What role did Robert Morgenthau play in Trump's operations and why was he significant to Trump?,"Robert Morgenthau, the US attorney for the southern district of New York and the district attorney of Manhattan, played a significant role in Trump's operations.

Morgenthau never opened any investigations into Trump and always believed there was nothing to see. He brought Trump onto the board of the Police Athletic Association, hosted a tribute dinner for him, and accepted campaign contributions. Morgenthau's lack of investigation allowed Trump to operate without scrutiny from the prosecutors.",04e36589d4724fc4deb8facca30e2ad2

Trump accuses DeSantis of spreading 'Missing Melania' flyers                   . Donald Trump  has accused his 2024 rival Ron DeSantis of spreading ""Missing Melania"" flyers at the Iowa  football game he attended.  The former first lady has barely been seen since departing the White House  with the now four-times indicted former president in January 2021. She reportedly wants ""nothing to do with "" his legal troubles.  Mr Trump was heckled by fans at the Iowa State game on Saturday in the key early-voting state, and a plane with a ""Where's Melania?"" banner even flew over the stadium.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is still under fire from the far right of the Republican Party despite agreeing to back an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.  Florida Rep Matt Gaetz is especially ardent in his opposition to Mr McCarthy who agreed to a number of demands in order to secure the votes of the right-wing of the party to become speaker.  As Eric Garciareports from Capitol Hill :. ""Mr Speaker, you are out of compliance with the agreement that allowed you to assume this role,"" Mr Gaetz said. ""The path forward for the House of Representatives is to either bring you into immediate total compliance or remove you, pursuant to a motion to vacate the chair."". A motion to vacate would trigger a no-confidence vote, even though Mr Gaetz acknowledged it might not pass. Specifically, Mr Gaetz criticised the fact that the House had not staged a vote on term limits for members, an amendment to balance the federal budget or to release all of the tapes from the January 6 riot.","What demands did the far right of the Republican Party have for Kevin McCarthy to back an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, and what specific criticisms does Republican Representative Matt Gaetz have of McCarthy?","The far right of the Republican Party had several demands for Kevin McCarthy to back an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.

7,"North Korea denied previously supplying Russia with rockets and missiles to use in Ukraine. In July, Putin's defense minister Sergei Shoigu was in Pyongyang as Kim showed off his latest weapons, long-range missiles and military drones. Shoigu said Russia may even be staging joint military drills with the North. National Security Advisor John Kirby says Putin must be embarrassed asking Kim for help.  JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: He's going to North Korea to try to get artillery shells and the basic materials so that he can continue to shore up his defense industrial base. There is no other way to look at that than desperation and weakness, quite frankly. T. RIPLEY: The North Korean leader has a lot to gain.  UNKNOWN: A large power is now dependent on him. That hasn't happened in a while.  RIPLEY: Kim may be willing to roll the dice, risking travel outside his borders, reducing the risk on a slow-moving, heavily fortified train. A shade of army green on the outside, luxuriously appointed on the inside. The train is a symbol of three generations of the Kim family dynasty and a nation stuck in the past. The need to travel over land means the meeting would likely be in Russia's far east, Vladivostok.  [03:05:00]. Kim has taken his chugging locomotive to Vladivostok before, meeting with Putin there in 2019. This time, Kim may hope Russia will help him with oil supplies or even technology to use in its own ambitious ballistic missile program, goals perhaps worthy of a rare venture beyond his nation's hermetically sealed borders.  Only once has Kim boarded a flight overseas. He borrowed an Air China jet from Beijing to get to his first Singapore meeting with Donald Trump. So much has changed since those bygone days of U.S.-North Korea diplomacy. Now, Russia is ready to make a deal, making Kim perhaps the most powerful North Korean leader ever.",What are some potential goals that Kim Jong Un may have for his meeting with Putin in Vladivostok?,"Kim Jong Un may have several potential goals for his meeting with Putin in Vladivostok. One goal could be to secure oil supplies from Russia, as mentioned in the excerpt. Additionally, Kim may be seeking technology assistance from Russia to further develop North Korea's ballistic missile program. This aligns with the goal of reducing North Korea's dependence on external powers and increasing its own power and influence, as suggested by the statement that a ""large power is now dependent on him.""

In June, Appen faced charges from the U.S. National Labor Relations Board after allegedly firing six freelancers who spoke out publicly about frustrations with workplace conditions. The workers were later reinstated. . Appen employees who spoke to CNBC on behalf of the company in recent months said the rapidly changing AI environment poses challenges. Erik Vogt, vice president of solutions at Appen, told CNBC in May that the sector was in a state of flux. . ""There's a lot of uncertainty, a lot of tentativeness for experimentation, and new startups trying out new things,"" Vogt said.

Judge Timothy Kelly has been reluctant to buy into the terrorism enhancement, which is part of what prosecutors are arguing merits such a long sentence. He has not been endorsing that.

The previous four members of the Proud Boys, three of them leaders who are also like Enrique Tarrio, convicted of seditious conspiracy, all of them have received long sentences.  Ethan Nordean, 18 years; Joseph Biggs, 17 years; Zachary Rehl, 15 years and then Dominic Pezzola, 10 years.

The gainer was equities, the best leading indicator of risk-taking, which was up two percentage points – once again, a big move when you're talking about 2 per cent of $US40 trillion in assets.  ""It's literally watching the world's assets actually move in terms of mix, and those are very large moves,"" Aboaf, best known on Wall Street as the treasurer tasked with fixing Citi's balance sheet in the financial crisis, says.  ""In fact, the equities move is quite striking."" While those moves were in July, Aboaf says the trend held up in early August.  So, why the ""turnaround"", as Aboaf puts it, a leap back into equities and risk after retreating for nearly six months straight? He's been talking to clients to try to find out.  ""Part of it is the absence of the anxieties they had and the absence of the scepticism they had about how the economy would develop and so forth,"" he says, referring to fears about geopolitical and banking system risks.  ""The other version is it's FOMO. They don't want to be left out of the new rally, whether it's the tech/AI/EV rally, or the transition economy rally.

State Street's big Australian clients include the likes of Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust and Rest Super.  Aboaf knows a bit about FOMO. The World Cup part of his trip is not a junket – he says he bought tickets, having been disappointed when his wife and daughter left him at home to go to the 2019 Women's World Cup in France, and this time they were doing it together.  He is heading to the Women's World Cup final in Sydney on Sunday night, having been to the Australia v England semi-final earlier in the week.

Russia 's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine  has been raging for one year now as the conflict continues to record devastating casualties and force the mass displacement of millions of blameless Ukrainians.  Vladimir Putin  began the war by claiming Russia's neighbour needed to be ""demilitarised and de-Nazified"",  a baseless pretext on which to launch a landgrab against an independent state that happens to have a Jewish president in Volodymyr Zelensky. . Ukraine has fought back courageously against Mr Putin's warped bid to restore territory lost to Moscow with the collapse of the Soviet Union  and has continued to defy the odds by defending itself against Russian onslaughts with the help of Western military aid.

WONG: They certainly got a strong pushback from the U.S. And so, what America has done now is going to be the big issue in the world. This new relationship -- the new defining feature of U.S.-China relationship is no longer one of engagement but one of strategic competition. People say it's full spectrum strategic competition but it's really extreme competition.  And what we worry about is what can go wrong in this dynamic.

Diplomacy as we are always reminded does not operate in a linear fashion. It's not a straight line. It curves and bends.  But we have to talk if there are issues which are irreconcilable.

7,"The new approach will enable suppliers to weigh local factors such as climate conditions, population and lot size -- and to account for past investments in conservation, Oppenheimer said.  ""It incorporates more of a water-budget-based approach, so it does a much better job of accounting for each of these unique characteristics,"" he said.  The approach means some regions will face much stronger cuts in order to comply.  Nearly 230 agencies serving 27 million urban water users in the state are already on track to meet 2025 standards, according to provisional data released by the water board.  But at least 36 agencies serving about 1.42 million users will need to make significant reductions of 20% or more to meet the target.  The targets are based on a formula that calculates efficient indoor and outdoor water use, leak losses and other factors. Targets may also include variances for unique local conditions -- such as areas with high livestock populations -- and bonuses for investments in water recycling and other incentives.  The standard for indoor water use will be 47 gallons per person per day by 2025 and drop to 42 gallons per person per day in 2030.  ""I think the standards are important for helping communities be better prepared for a hotter, drier climate,"" said Heather Cooley, research director at the Pacific Institute, a water think tank in Oakland. ""This is an important step in the right direction in helping communities become more resilient."". Cooley and other researchers estimated in a report last year that California could shrink total urban water use by 30% or more using existing technologies and practices to improve water efficiency.  She said the efforts that have gone into developing the targets thus far, such as gathering data on differences in local climate conditions and development patterns, have helped to create a customized approach for tracking efficiency, something that will help cities and agencies tailor their policies.  ""Certainly, the data aren't perfect.

7,"Trees, vegetation and soil also don't get as hot as concrete, and they disperse most of the heat they do grab down deeper into the ground.  But urban planners are hardly in a position to tear up miles of roadway or pull down hundreds of buildings and homes in order to replace them with vast swaths of trees, parks and gardens. Given the limited space that can be devoted to greenery, the question becomes one of where limited numbers of green plots can be placed to do the most good.  Simulation of climate change impact on temperatures. Courtesy of Siradel. A digital twin is designed to consider such scenarios, but its effectiveness depends on the richness of the data it has about the particular city, and on accurate mathematical models about weather impacts. In its years-long effort to build its Urban Climate Resilience Toolkit, Siradel worked with climate and weather scientists to incorporate their formulas into its own software, and with construction, materials and agronomic engineers to ensure the software could accurately model how buildings, roads and parks interact with sunlight, heat, wind and water.  Loading the resulting models with detailed data about specific cities was an even bigger challenge. To get data on 3,000 major cities around the world, Siradel first grabbed what publicly available information it could on city layouts, building sizes and greenery. To flesh those basic pictures out, it pulled in what 3-D digital models were available for individual buildings—models that architects now routinely develop for their projects, and typically leave on file with cities. ""Some of these models go down to the level of individual bricks,"" says Belliard.  That still left plenty of gaps in most cities. To close them, Siradel sent people driving around cities with car-roof-mounted video-mapping devices aimed at buildings. And since cities in Europe, Asia and some other regions are webbed with tiny alleys too small for cars to get through, the company also sent people with backpack-mounted versions of the video-mapping equipment walking through the alleys.  Finally, Siradel layered demographic data into its urban databases. That way the models could be informed not only by how many people live in a given building or neighborhood, but also about whether they are especially vulnerable to weather-related pressures.",What challenges did Siradel face in collecting data for its Urban Climate Resilience Toolkit?,"Siradel faced several challenges in collecting data for its Urban Climate Resilience Toolkit. One challenge was obtaining accurate mathematical models about weather impacts, which required collaboration with climate and weather scientists.

Geneva — More than 1,300 schools have been destroyed in government-held areas of Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion and others have been badly damaged, the UN children's fund Unicef said on Tuesday.  Persistent attacks mean that only about a third of school-age children there are attending classes fully in person and many are forgetting what they have already learnt, it said.  Beyond Ukraine, more than half of the children whose families have fled the conflict to seven countries are not enrolled in national education, Unicef said, citing language barriers and overstretched education systems.

But experts believe it was made worse by the authorities who opened floodgates on dams, releasing more than 1 trillion gallons of water — equivalent to 1.6 million Olympic swimming pools — into nearby villages and farmland.  ""They chose to protect some so-called important areas and abandon some so-called not important areas. It's a political decision,"" Wang said.  Some residents in these areas interviewed by The Post said they weren't aware that they lived in flood storage zones. Others said government flood control staff didn't notify them before their homes were inundated and all their belongings destroyed.  It may never be known how many people died or were displaced as a result of these decisions, but at least 29 people in Hebei perished during the flooding. About 1.75 million people were relocated, including more than 900,000 from zones where houses were flooded. The economic damage totaled $13 billion in a province where rural incomes are less than a quarter of incomes in Beijing.  China's Ministry of Water Resources and the Hebei Water Resources Department did not respond to repeated requests for comment.  Authorities knew of risks to villages. As the rain hammered China's northeast at the end of July, waters surged down the Baigou and South Juma rivers toward Xiong'an. Hebei flood control authorities quickly shut the Baigouyin Gate, stopping the deluge from reaching a lake in Xiong'an.","Who is responsible for allowing towns in designated flood zones to grow despite regulations, and how did their actions contribute to the severity of the recent flooding in China?","The responsibility for allowing towns in designated flood zones to grow despite regulations lies with the local government. These local governments approved the construction of homes in these flood-prone areas, disregarding the regulations meant to control the number of residents living there. Their actions contributed to the severity of the recent flooding in China because they did not enforce the rules and allowed the population in these areas to increase. Additionally, the authorities opened floodgates on dams, releasing a significant amount of water into nearby villages and farmland, which worsened the flooding. This was described as a political decision by Wang Weiluo, an engineer and expert on China's water system. The lack of proper notifications and inadequate flood control measures resulted in the loss of lives, displacement of millions of people, and significant economic damage. The excerpt mentions that the China's Ministry of Water Resources and the Hebei Water Resources Department did not respond to requests for comment.",ec8087110053d8f9b3a150e97a5faf31

Moreover, these three countries are moving towards interlinked security environments inching towards Mini-NATO mechanism. It is seriously concerning that the mini-NATO planned around serving the US' strategic competition with China and weakens China's development prospects are being chalked out. Trilateral framework could be gradually institutionalized in these countries in coming years, creating further uncertainty and instability in the region.  Mere using diplomatic language the three countries actually tried to forge their image as defenders of peace and stability in the so-called Indo-Pacific region rather that troublemakers and creators of camp confrontation.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin rightly urged these three countries to uphold true multilateralism amid a complex international security situation, as the Pacific region is a highland of peace and development which should not be an arena for geopolitical games.  Yet though both Seoul and Tokyo are bent by US military bases and politics, conflicting ground realities indicate declining political grip and acceptability of South Korean President Yoon, as his pro-US policies and his olive branch offering to Japan has been labeled as national disgrace. Kishida's approval rating at home is neither satisfactory.  Current policies of the leaders of Japan and South Korea reflect a lack of independence, making their diplomatic approach unbalanced, which will surely impact these leaders domestically.  It is worrying that the trilateral Camp David summit is bringing more regional risks and military drills with Japanese military machines crossing the border against the pacifist spirit of its Constitution. It is indeed renewed of forming new camp confrontation and military blocs into the Asia-Pacific region, a US-led effort to tie Japan and South Korea to its warlike chariot, especially as pawns, in pursuit of a new-generation US strategy to be used against China.","What concerns do regional experts have about the trilateral framework between the US, Japan, and South Korea in relation to China's development prospects and regional stability in the Indo-Pacific region?","Regional experts are concerned that the trilateral framework between the US, Japan, and South Korea, which is seen as a ""Mini-NATO"" serving the US' strategic competition with China, could weaken China's development prospects and create uncertainty and instability in the Indo-Pacific region.

ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Euphoric celebration for a historic Women's World cup quickly turned into a moment of reckoning, when Luis Rubiales, president of the Spanish Football Federation, planted a forceful kiss on player Jennifer Hermoso during the medal ceremony in Sydney.  The kiss she later said she had not consented to. Facing domestic and international criticism, Rubiales was pressured to resign, but he defiantly refused He doubled down, saying the kiss was consensual, to the applause of men in the room.  LUIS RUBIALES, PRESIDENT OF THE SPANISH FOOTBALL FEDERATION (through translator): You think I have to resign? Well, I'm going to tell you something. I will not resign.  SHUBERT (voice-over): Hermoso issued her own lengthy response, which said the kiss was not consensual at all. I felt vulnerable and a victim of an impulse-driven, sexist, out of place act without any consent on my part, she wrote.  Since then, FIFA, the world's governing football body, provisionally suspended Rubiales for 90 days, and the Spanish government has submitted a complaint to its sports tribunal, a step towards suspending him.

Lawyer John Eastman, who faces disbarment in California over his effort to assist former President Trump in overturning the 2020 election result, was characterized by an attorney for former Vice President Mike Pence as a ""serpent in Trump's ear."". This characterization, while correct, is misleading.  It's correct because it accurately indicates that Eastman was giving Trump fallacious legal information, and it's reasonable to believe that Eastman knew he was doing that.  But it's misleading because it implies that Trump was simply given bad advice by a lawyer. The reality is that Trump was actively seeking such a ""serpent"" to give him a justification, any justification, for preventing certification of Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.  Eastman and Trump acted as a pair of rattlesnakes and were attempting to destroy our rule of law with their poisonous venom. It's appropriate that Eastman is facing disbarment in California and that both he and Trump are facing criminal charges in Georgia.  David Michels, Encino. ::. The State Bar's rushed attempt to disbar Eastman is a shameful kangaroo court.  In the usual case where civil or criminal proceedings are pending relating to the bar charges, the bar delays the discipline until the court makes its decision, particularly where there is little or no risk of harm to clients, and 5th Amendment rights are at stake.  Why not here? Because the bar is still embarrassed by the Tom Girardi matter. Now it wants to pose as the guardian of democracy in a case that is 90% political, going after somebody who is a pariah of the local legal establishment anyway.  This is a piece of cake for the prosecution, which can just latch onto U.S. District Judge David O. Carter's ""more likely than not"" prejudgment of Eastman's guilt.

Japan has told the World Trade Organization (WTO) that China's ban on Japanese seafood after the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant was ""totally unacceptable"", the Japanese foreign ministry said late on Monday.  In a counterargument to China's Aug. 31 notification to WTO on its measures to suspend Japanese aquatic imports, which started last month, Japan said it would explain its positions in relevant WTO committees and urged China to immediately repeal the action.  Some Japanese officials have signaled the country may file a WTO complaint, which the U.S. ambassador to Japan said last week the United States would support.  Japan will explain the safety of the released water at diplomatic forums, including the ASEAN Summit in Indonesia and G20 Summit in India this month, chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters on Tuesday.

South Korea and the United States said on Friday that military co-operation between North Korea and Russia would violate UN sanctions against Pyongyang and that the allies would ensure there was a price to pay. Russia has gone out of its way to publicise Kim's visit and drop repeated hints about the prospect of military co-operation with North Korea, which was formed in 1948 with the backing of the Soviet Union. For Putin, who says Moscow is locked in an existential battle with the West over Ukraine, courting Kim allows him to needle Washington and its Asian allies while potentially securing a deep supply of artillery for the Ukraine war. Washington has accused North Korea of providing arms to Russia, which has the world's biggest store of nuclear warheads, but it is unclear whether any deliveries have been made.

Turning 15 is marked as a significant moment of maturity in many cultures around the world.In Latin America, for example, the ""quinceañera"", or in Brazilian Portuguese, the ""festa de quinze anos"" marks the transition to adulthood for young women. In China, it generally corresponds with finishing compulsory middle school and then transitioning to either high school or vocational training. In South Africa, upon reaching 15, one can choose to leave school, be employed and get married with parental or guardian consent.  The 2023 BRICS summit is the group's 15th annual summit, in a year that will likely be remembered as marking when BRICS came of age. International organizations are not like children, of course, but they do struggle to survive in their early years, needing great care and attention, and inevitably go through significant changes as they start to mature in a world that is constantly changing.

That is a massive wind fall for the Trump war chest. So absolutely, he's definitely using this to his advantage.  NOBILO: Thomas, I apologize for how broad this question is, but we so frequently talk about polarization in American politics. Obviously the higher the stakes get the more the situation with the former president escalates. Surely the deeper that polarization becomes. Because for Democrats, this is considered I think embarrassing that former president is going through this legal process but perhaps a relief that the legal system is doing its job.

And it is kind of remarkable, I think to some degree, how routine this has all become. You know, nothing about these primaries or Trump's court cases are typical. So I think it is unclear how the standard rules apply and what this actually means for the fabric of American democracy.  We're kind of in this bizarre situation that Trump is winning the GOP primaries by infinity points. He's also facing these four indictments. He's running a campaign essentially outside of a courtroom. And all of his rivals look like they're either gunning for second place or their candidacies are on life support. Plus, it's only August.

So, we're on a several years long slide against institutions.  And I'll be honest, I don't think the current occupant of the White House has done much to restore a lot of faith in institutions in some ways. I don't know that any Republicans believe that he has lived up to his pronouncements on that front.  Somebody after an election is going to have to do it. I don't know who it's going to be.

This was part of the city's pilot programme to name heatwaves, backed by the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center (Arsht-Rock), which is linked to the US thinktank the Atlantic Council. The classification system, launched in 2022, is for now applicable to Seville alone, with names considered when hot conditions reach category 3, the highest level, for three days (it is a five-tier system, with categories from 0 to 3 and an additional no-warning category).  ""It's really important that the name be tied to a specific methodology,"" says Kurt Shickman, the director of extreme heat initiatives at Arsht-Rock. ""Naming a heatwave because it's hotter and people are talking about it isn't as important as having a name when you clearly see it's going to be dangerous for human health over a certain series of days."".

In a technical paper prepared by a WMO meeting in October 2022, the organisation addresses a ""recent civil society effort originating in the United States"" to name heatwaves, and argued that rushed naming could create confusion among the public and interfere with official and established warning systems.  This summer's heatwave garnered at least three names: Cerberus, Xenia Sevilla and Cleon, as the Greek, Israeli and Cypriot meteorological services jointly called it.

RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Pollsters didn't see it coming Daniel Naboa was not among the leading candidates in the weeks before Sunday's first round. But after a solid performance during the presidential debate held exactly a week before the election, voters gave the 35-year-old businessman and former member of the Ecuadorian National Assembly, the right to go to the second round. Daniel Naboa was the son of Alvaro Naboa who was also a member of the assembly and ran unsuccessfully for President three times. He will face Luisa Gonzalez, the protege of former Ecuadorian firebrand President Rafael Correa, a leftist who governed the South American country for 10 years starting in 2007.  After her win, Gonzalez said Ecuador urgently needs peace, jobs and security, and repeated what she has said during her campaign that our return to the policies of Correa would allow the country to get out of a wave of insecurity that has made it one of the most violent in the region.  In his first remarks after winning the chance to go to the second round, Naboa emphasized his platform focuses on security for Ecuador and employment. He's hoping to rule a country that has been shaken by multiple acts of political violence.  On August 9, Fernando Villavicencio, a 59-year-old investigative journalist and former lawmaker was gunned down when he was leaving on rally in Quito, the capital and then on Thursday, Naboa himself said his own campaign was attacked as the candidate traveled with his entourage in the city of Duran in Guayas province.  Hundreds of inmates have died in the last year during clashes inside prisons between local drug gangs with the government's seemingly unable to put an end to the violence.

Weighing the likely contenders. In this regard, aspirants such as Saudi Arabia and Mexico seem the least likely to make the cut in the short term. That's despite the Saudis' oil wealth and Mexico's leftist-progressive leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. Although they might be currently experiencing rocky relations with Washington, they have proven to be capable of rapprochement following previous disagreements with the US, with which they seem inextricably intertwined.  Saudi Arabia has a long-term military relationship with the US, while Mexico is the US's number-one trading partner.  Of equal importance in the evaluation of potential new members is the relationship the aspirants have with the existing BRICS members. This is because another crucial lesson has been the tiff between two of its largest members, China and India, over their disputed border. As a result of the uneasy relationship between two of its members, the bloc has become alert to the importance of direct bilateral relations and dispute resolution among its constituent leaders.  Among the applicants, Saudi Arabia, which has had a fractious relationship with Moscow in the past, seems to face an uphill climb. It also has difficult relations with Iran, another applicant, despite their recent rapprochement.

BIROL: Exactly your competitor, when we look at the numbers in the energy world, which is very, there is a very clear trend, clean energy is moving fast and faster than many people believe it is the solar panels, which means electric cars, hydrogen, everything, and all of them need critical minerals, as we call it, in order to be built.

Most of the former coal companies are not transforming mining companies for critical minerals, and they're coming to Africa.  CHATTERLEY: Yes.  BIROL: In my view, Africa has two, at least two major jobs to do here; the government's having good equitable contracts with those companies so that they make the real benefit from having them hosting them here.

When Nadaraja checked in with her daughter using a friend's Starlink and saw the weather, she decided to leave a little earlier than planned.  At 4 pm on Friday, the heavens opened and almost immediately transformed the playa dust into claylike mud that sucked everything—boots, bikes, beer cans—into it.

False rumors circulated on social media that Ebola had shown up and the National Guard had been called.  Most Burners, however, were content to take the time to hunker down and connect with friends.

Sept 12 (Reuters) - German premium footwear brand Birkenstock on Tuesday filed for an initial public offering in the United States, underscoring a pickup in the country's equity markets and becoming the second big European company to seek a foreign listing this month.  Its filing with the U.S. securities regulator did not disclose the financial details of the offering, but revealed that net revenue for the six months ended March 31 rose 19% to 644.17 million euros ($692.87 million) and profit fell 45.3% to 40.21 million euros.  The German sandal maker's IPO ambitions come hot on the heels of filings by British chipmaker Arm, data automation provider Klaviyo and grocery delivery app Instacart, as equity markets in the U.S. thaw after a murky economic outlook led to a slow start to the year.  Birkenstock's filing also follows the marketing blitz around blockbuster movie ""Barbie"", in which star Margot Robbie was seen donning a pair of pink Birkenstocks, boosting the popularity of the comfort-focused footwear among fashion aficionados.  SoftBank Group-owned Arm and now Birkenstock's decision to list outside Europe comes as IPO markets in the region wade through a lackluster year, with volumes far below 2021's record levels.

Also, as Democrats will surely keep reminding them, Hunter Biden is not running for any office, let alone for president.  One interesting aspect of Hunter Biden's case is that his lawyers think that they can still negotiate a plea deal that collapsed in July - and that they can use the recent expansion of gun rights by some courts as part of his defense.  After all, the Constitution does not say anything about drug addicts being unable to own guns.  ALSO READ| Donald Trump's last-minute legal challenge threatens to disrupt New York fraud trial against him. That would be a remarkable irony given where most Democrats stand on gun control. On Thursday, Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader of the House of Representatives, announced an impeachment inquiry into President Biden - a move that the White House dismissed as a political stunt.  Mr McCarthy said there were ""serious and credible allegations"" about the family's business dealings and President Biden's conduct. And Republicans hope this new inquiry will implicate the president in abuse of power and corruption.  However, so far, seven months of existing investigations into Hunter Biden have only produced bits of evidence from former business partners, an FBI informant, and some IRS agents, but nothing that proves any wrongdoing.  That may change when they start issuing subpoenas, but the Republican majority in the House is so thin, that it is not certain that they would win an impeachment vote on the House floor, if it ever got there.

5,"You see yourself as a hero in this epic story. And the battle is negativity or positivity, which one am I choosing? And you've got to choose the positive to overcome the negative.  KILMEADE: So interesting. And here's an excerpt from your book that I think expands on that. Jon, let's use your voice since you're the pro.  GORDON: Our brain tunes into both positive and negative frequencies. The more we tune into negative thoughts, such as fear worry, doubt, jealousy, anger, or unworthiness, these thoughts negatively affect our antenna, which causes us to tune into and receive more negative thoughts.  When we tune into a positive frequency, positive thoughts such as love, hope, joy, love, faith and purpose. We create a strong and healthy antenna, that tunes into more positive thoughts.  KILMEADE: Gotcha. You broke it down to the five Ds. So here we go get a pen.  All right. First off doubt.  GORDON: Yes, doubts always coming in. It starts with a seed of doubt. Do I have what it takes? Am I enough? Am I going to get through this? Am I going to overcome this challenge? And then it grows into a forest of uncertainty and fear.  KILMEADE: Stop it and get to yourself and understand that you have the courage and confidence to be there.  Distortion. You pretend as if something outside is bigger than it actually is.  GORDON: Right? That's not really pretend, it's the fact that you believe the lies and distortions are negative thoughts and negative thoughts are lies that will tell you things about yourself and your future that just aren't true.  The key is, don't believe the lies. Speak truth to the lies.  KILMEADE: Discouragement.","What are the five Ds mentioned in the excerpt that can negatively affect our thoughts, according to the book?","The five Ds mentioned in the excerpt that can negatively affect our thoughts, according to the book, are doubt, distortion, discouragement, jealousy, and despair. Doubt starts with questioning one's abilities and can grow into uncertainty and fear. Distortion involves believing negative thoughts and lies about oneself and the future. Discouragement refers to feeling disheartened and lacking motivation. Jealousy involves comparing oneself to others and feeling envious. Despair refers to a sense of hopelessness and negativity.",ca7573779ec985dcc95e4adc86ca4a52
5,"President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday praised what he said was the use of new Ukrainian weaponry with a range of 700 km - roughly the distance from Ukraine's border to Pskov, where a Russian military airbase was engulfed in flames a day earlier.   No negotiations!. Ukraine has hit back at critics of the slow progress of its much-vaunted counteroffensive in the east and south that has been hampered by heavily-mined areas and Russian defensive lines that were prepared over the course of months.     The operation is nearing the three-month mark but has not yet recaptured any major settlements. Russia calls the Ukrainian push a failure; Kyiv says it is advancing slowly on purpose to minimize losses.     Podolyak said Kyiv's forces were continuing to advance and hoped that Western military aid would continue to come in the months ahead. He used forthright language to rule out the expediency for Ukraine of any negotiations with Russia.     ""Any negotiation process... it will mean the capitulation of Ukraine and the capitulation of the democratic world on the whole,"" he said.     Podolyak said he believed Ukraine's Western allies, who have poured in billions of dollars of weaponry, understood that there could be no kind of ""compromise"" with Moscow.     ""At the moment, the partners understand that this war will no longer end in a compromise solution - that is, either we destroy Russia's capabilities by military means, and to do this we need the appropriate tools, or this war with such level of aggression will continue for some time.""",What is the current status of Ukraine's counteroffensive in the east and south?,"The current status of Ukraine's counteroffensive in the east and south is that it has been hampered by heavily-mined areas and Russian defensive lines that were prepared over the course of months.

5,"Beyond militarization. Not satisfied with already surrounding China with more than 300 military bases, United States President Joe Biden used the Camp David summit with Japan and the Republic of Korea to further advance his agenda to contain China.  The US, Japan and the ROK agreed to a new ""duty to consult"" security pledge committing them to speak with each other in the event of a security crisis or threat in the Pacific. The statement seems superfluous because such consultations already take place. But its intent signals a greater threat to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region because it is an extension of US efforts to expand NATO into a global network.  What motivation brings these uneasy participants together?. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is a willing partner because the deepening US engagement supports Japan's wish to remilitarize. Japan has abandoned the principle of a defence-oriented strategy and boosted its counterstrike capability. Japan has also allowed the US to station an advanced Marine Corps unit in Okinawa. This is all painted as a defensive response to alleged adversaries but it begs the question — who is planning to disrupt trade with China, Japan's largest trading partner? It's certainly not China, although that is the clear focus of the Camp David summit.  Some in Japan fear that bolstering security cooperation will lead the country into an economic Cold War with its biggest trading partner. Others in the region worry that Japan's military objectives extend further, perhaps supporting the US' attempts to stir up the situation across the Taiwan Strait.  The ROK remains beholden to the US as a necessary bastion of support in the continuing conflict with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea because the ROK refused to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement. There is a 70-year truce in hostilities but technically a state of war still exists. It is little wonder that the DPRK feels it is under constant threat of attack.  Being reliant on US military support, the ROK chose to accede to US policy directives at Camp David despite the widespread lingering distrust of Japan's political motivations and commitment to peaceful stability.","What are the concerns and motivations behind the recent ""duty to consult"" security pledge between the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, and how does it impact the stability and relationships in the Asia-Pacific region?","The concerns behind the recent ""duty to consult"" security pledge between the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea are rooted in the perceived threat posed by China. The pledge is seen as an extension of US efforts to expand NATO into a global network and contains implications for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida views the deepening US engagement as an opportunity to remilitarize and bolster Japan's counterstrike capability. However, some in Japan fear that this increased security cooperation could lead to an economic Cold War with China, their largest trading partner. There are also concerns that Japan's military objectives may extend further and support US attempts to provoke tension in the Taiwan Strait. The Republic of Korea, reliant on US military support, opted to accede to US policy directives despite lingering distrust of Japan's political motivations and commitment to peaceful stability. The ""duty to consult"" pledge ultimately reflects the complex dynamics and power struggles in the region surrounding China's rise as a global power.",c3ff15c4380c47e1e3420af9b514e8c7

""I worry about the drones falling on Moscow,"" Pavel admits. ""But we decided we wouldn't talk about politics - so that we don't argue and provoke each other."". Many people seem reluctant to dwell on what's happening in cities and towns in Ukraine - less than one day's drive away.

Very few people walk the streets in clothing displaying the letter Z or other symbols of Russia's war. Among most, there is indifference, resignation or meek acceptance.  This mood is also prevalent among many of those in the corridors of power, according to a source close to the Kremlin, who speaks to me on condition of anonymity.

5,"""These approaches will embolden wealthy nations and large corporations to continue polluting the world, much to Africa's detriment,"" the groups said in the letter.  Amos Wemanya, a senior adviser at Power Shift Africa, one of the signatories, said financing should come from richer countries meeting the commitments they have previously made to poorer ones but so far have only met in part.  Host Kenya, which says it accounts for a quarter of the carbon credits traded in Africa, hopes to be a model for Africa's ambitions in the market and has introduced legislation to try to attract investment.  In June, it hosted an auction where companies from Saudi Arabia bought more than 2.2 million tonnes of carbon credits.  One of the projects generating those credits is Kenya-based BURN Manufacturing's production of clean cooking stoves to replace heavily polluting wood and charcoal-based fires.  The income from the carbon credits allows BURN to sell its stoves to poor Kenyans at a subsidised rate of $12 per unit, instead of the production cost of $40-50, said Chris McKinney, BURN's chief commercial officer.  The company has sold more than 3.6 million stoves.  ""We have still barely scratched the surface. The scale of the problem is massive,"" he said.  One of the highlights of next week's summit, according to a published agenda, will be a deal involving the United Arab Emirates and the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI).  The ACMI was launched at the COP27 summit in Egypt last year with the aim of boosting Africa's carbon credit production from 16 million in 2020 to 300 million by 2030 and 1.5 billion by 2050.  Responding to criticism of carbon credits, Joseph Ng'ang'a, chief executive of the summit's secretariat, said they were an important tool to fight climate change but only one piece of the puzzle.  African nations will also continue to demand more funding from rich-world governments and seek additional recognition for the Congo Basin, the world's second largest tropical forest, as a major carbon sink, summit organisers said.",Why do African nations believe that financing for climate initiatives should come from richer countries?,"African nations believe that financing for climate initiatives should come from richer countries because these countries have previously made commitments to support poorer nations in their efforts to combat climate change. However, they have only partially fulfilled these commitments. The African nations argue that the funding should come from these wealthier nations as a means of meeting their obligations and to ensure that the global burden of pollution is not disproportionately borne by Africa.

Being able to pass for a native speaker in Germany and France was no doubt what drew the men ""from Vauxhall Cross"" [MI6 headquarters] to him, he remarks. Not that his languages helped him at school.  ""They were four years I deeply disliked. It drove me into myself and made me solitary. Back then the class division was very rigid - professional, trade and working class. I was trade, and a scholarship boy, so the bullying was relentless from those whose dads were accountants or doctors or lawyers.

5,"These days, Latin America's biggest economy is far from the dynamo it was in the 2000s. But Lula still looks to have a bit of the Midas touch.  The economy grew a better-than-expected 1.9 percent in the first quarter, according to government data, and analysts predict growth of two to 2.5 percent for this year.  Lula also scored a key victory last Tuesday when Brazil's Congress passed new budget rules, ditching strict spending caps and enabling the administration to free up money for social and infrastructure programs, in exchange for more-flexible deficit-slashing targets.  Getting the bill through the conservative-majority Congress would have been unthinkable a few months ago.  ""The government showed its capacity to organize and get its projects approved,"" said political scientist Mayra Goulart of Rio de Janeiro Federal University.  The Congressional backing comes at a cost: Lula is expected to announce a cabinet reshuffle soon to reward centrist parties for their support.  Lula got another legislative win in July, when the lower house passed tax reforms that were decades in the making. That bill now heads to the Senate.  Fitch upgraded Brazil's credit rating last month from BB- to BB, citing the government's economic reforms.  Not all observers are convinced by these positives, however.  ""For the government to respect the new budget rules, it will have to increase its revenues. And that's looking difficult,"" said economist Pedro Paulo Silveira.  Lula has also faced criticism at times for his close ties with Russia and China, and his reluctance to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Bolsonaro and his allies have meanwhile been weakened by a series of scandals and police investigations.  In June, electoral authorities barred Bolsonaro from running for office for eight years over his unproven allegations the voting system is fraud-prone, sidelining him from the next presidential elections, in 2026.  As the opposition struggles, Lula has been busy burnishing his international image, meeting with world leaders, giving a speech on climate change to a giant crowd in Paris in June and hosting a summit of Amazon rainforest nations earlier this month.","What were the recent legislative victories for Lula's administration in Brazil, and what potential challenges does the government face in implementing the new budget rules?","Recent legislative victories for Lula's administration in Brazil include the passage of new budget rules and tax reforms.

ZACH COHEN, CNN REPORTER: It's hard to know what to expect, being in uncharted waters here, guys with you, but you know, we do expect as you said, former president to fly down to Atlanta, Georgia, where we are now at the Fulton County jail, which is a couple miles from where I'm standing right now and be booked as a defendant in that jail, a criminal defendant.  Now, it's -- it remains to be seen what that process will look like. But we do know that the defendants in this case, there are 19 of them total, and about nine have turned themselves in so far. All of those nine people have been treated exactly like any other defendant would be when they surrender themselves to a jail. That means they were given a mugshot, that means they were fingerprinted.  You know, we are talking about a former president here, and so, it remains to be seen if he will follow that same trend, but you know, we've seen a tightened security around the jail and here at the courthouse in anticipation of Trump's visit to Atlanta, Georgia. And as you mentioned, really interesting on a day that he's supposed to rather surrender, Fani Willis; the district attorney, the prosecutor in this case is requesting that a trial happen two months from now, like October of 2023.  Which is remarkably quick turnaround.

Moreover, these three countries are moving towards interlinked security environments inching towards Mini-NATO mechanism. It is seriously concerning that the mini-NATO planned around serving the US' strategic competition with China and weakens China's development prospects are being chalked out. Trilateral framework could be gradually institutionalized in these countries in coming years, creating further uncertainty and instability in the region.  Mere using diplomatic language the three countries actually tried to forge their image as defenders of peace and stability in the so-called Indo-Pacific region rather that troublemakers and creators of camp confrontation.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin rightly urged these three countries to uphold true multilateralism amid a complex international security situation, as the Pacific region is a highland of peace and development which should not be an arena for geopolitical games.  Yet though both Seoul and Tokyo are bent by US military bases and politics, conflicting ground realities indicate declining political grip and acceptability of South Korean President Yoon, as his pro-US policies and his olive branch offering to Japan has been labeled as national disgrace. Kishida's approval rating at home is neither satisfactory.  Current policies of the leaders of Japan and South Korea reflect a lack of independence, making their diplomatic approach unbalanced, which will surely impact these leaders domestically.  It is worrying that the trilateral Camp David summit is bringing more regional risks and military drills with Japanese military machines crossing the border against the pacifist spirit of its Constitution. It is indeed renewed of forming new camp confrontation and military blocs into the Asia-Pacific region, a US-led effort to tie Japan and South Korea to its warlike chariot, especially as pawns, in pursuit of a new-generation US strategy to be used against China.","What concerns are regional experts raising about the trilateral partnership between the US, Japan, and South Korea in relation to China's development prospects and regional stability in the Indo-Pacific?","Regional experts are concerned that the trilateral partnership between the US, Japan, and South Korea, known as the ""Mini-NATO,"" is a US-led effort to weaken China's development prospects and create uncertainty and instability in the Indo-Pacific region.

Elon Musk, expressing concerns about nuclear war following conversations with Russian government officials, personally intervened to block Ukraine from carrying out a drone strike on Moscow's Black Sea Fleet, according to a biographer who spoke with the CEO of SpaceX.  Since Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine's military has heavily relied on the satellite communications network known as Starlink, crediting it with allowing front-line troops to stay in contact with their commanders. The system is owned by SpaceX, which — with the help of private donations and US taxpayer funding — has provided Ukraine with thousands of Starlink terminals since February 2022.  But according to journalist Walter Isaacson, author of an upcoming biography on the SpaceX founder, the militarization of Starlink has made Musk deeply uncomfortable.  ""How am I in this war?"" Musk asked Isaacson during an interview, according to an excerpt from the book reported on by CNN. ""Starlink was not meant to be involved in wars. It was so people can watch Netflix and chill and get online for school and do good peaceful things, not drone strikes."". It has previously been reported — and admitted by SpaceX leadership — that steps have been taken to prevent Ukraine from using the Starlink system for certain attacks. Last fall, Ukrainian forces reported ""catastrophic"" outages in areas that had previously been occupied by Russia, suggesting the system had been deliberately deactivated there, possibly to deny Russian access (Musk, at the time, said information regarding Starlink's use on the battlefield was ""classified"").  In July, The New York Times, citing ""two people familiar with the discussions,"" reported that Musk had personally denied a Ukrainian request to allow Starlink to be used for a maritime drone attack near Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.",Why did Elon Musk block Ukraine's access to Starlink near Crimea?,"Elon Musk blocked Ukraine's access to Starlink near Crimea because he had concerns about nuclear war following conversations with Russian government officials.

What's happening inside North Korea? Since the pandemic, the window has slammed shut.  Why reopen the borders now?. During the lockdown, North Korea tried to make do with its ideology of self-reliance, such as boosting domestic manufacturing in limited areas, including textiles and agriculture. The regime has also ramped up its cybercrime activities to steal foreign currency in forms of cryptocurrency and other virtual assets, cyber analysts say.  But worsening economic conditions have pushed the Kim regime to seek external relief and partially reopen its borders to trade, according to experts.  ""The cost of isolation that piled up over the years, however, has reached a breaking point for Kim,"" said Heo Jeong-pil, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.  North Korea's economy shrank for three years in row from 2020, according to estimates by South Korea's central bank. The North's essential trade with its ally China tumbled to a decades-long low of $320 million in 2021, down 90 percent from pre-pandemic levels.  Following a limited resumption of freight traffic last year, trade with China rebounded rapidly to $1.06 billion during just the first half of 2023. Since May, train services between North Korea and China have increased to twice daily, and some customs facilities reopened in June, according to a parliamentary briefing by South Korea's National Intelligence Service.  And trade with Russia is increasing as well, though at lower levels than with China. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the growing global isolation of Moscow has pushed the Kremlin closer to the Kim regime.

NEW DELHI: Following India's lead, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have issued strong statements categorically rejecting the ""baseless map"" recently released by China that denotes most of the South China Sea and other contested territories as its sovereign land. What China claims On August 28, China's ministry of natural resources released a new ""standard"" national map as part of what it has called an ongoing effort to eliminate ""problem maps"". Along its southern border with India, it shows the Indian territories of Arunachal Pradesh and Doklam Plateau clearly within Chinese borders, along with Aksai Chin in the western section.  In the far northeastern corner of China on the border with Russia, it shows Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island, an island at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri rivers, as Chinese territory, even though the countries signed an agreement nearly 20 years ago to split the island. China also clearly shows its so-called nine-dash line, demarcating what it considers its maritime border, claiming almost the entirety of the South China Sea. The current, and other recent iterations of the annual map, include a 10th dash to the east of Taiwan.  India rejects China's 'absurd claims' India was the first to lodge a protest against the map, rejecting claims made by Beijing and saying they have no basis to claim India's territory. The ministry of external affairs said such steps from the Chinese side would only complicate the resolution of the boundary question. External affairs minister S Jaishankar said the issuance of the map was an ""old habit"" of China to stake claim to territories that do not belong to it. He dismissed Beijing's ""absurd claims"" and said ""putting out a map does not mean anything"". ""China has put out maps with territories (that are) not theirs. (It is an) old habit.

The American rapper and singer-songwriter, known for popularizing Auto-Tune with his hits such as ""Buy U a Drank"" and ""Bartender,"" is used to performing in front of thousands of screaming fans. But today, there's no crowd; instead, it's just T-Pain, a camera crew and a green screen.  It's a departure from the past, but a nod to the future. T-Pain is performing songs that will become a virtual reality (VR) concert, delivered directly to fans via VR headsets.  ""I'm definitely used to bigger stages,"" T-Pain (whose real name is Faheem Rashad Najm) tells CNN during an interview on set, adding that he typically uses feedback from the crowd to ""really gain my energy ... (so) it's just a lot more awkward."". That doesn't mean he isn't excited about the opportunity. ""I'm just a nerd,"" he says, who dabbles in VR and 3D software as a hobby at home. When AmazeVR, the company behind what was billed as the world'sfirst VR concert tour with artist Megan Thee Stallion last year, approached him for a collaboration, the Florida-born artist was ready to try a new experience.  ""The fans are going to be a lot closer,"" T-Pain says. ""You get to see different angles, you get to see a different kind of performance ... AmazeVR is kind of like putting (me) in your living room."". Capturing the ""perfect"" take. AmazeVR was founded in 2015, and has raised more than $50 million in the last four years, including a recent boost in December after Apple announced its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, according to the company.

The company would also give workers a $5,500 bonus for ratifying the contract. Ford initially offered a 9 percent wage increase over the four-year contract and a lump-sum payment equaling 6 percent of wages.  The carmakers have warned that acceding to the UAW's demands would make it difficult for them to compete against competitors like Tesla and foreign auto companies that do not have unionized workforces.  ""We will not make a deal that endangers our ability to invest, grow and share profits with our employees,"" Ford President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley said last month in a statement. ""That would mortgage our future and would be harmful to everyone with a stake in Ford, including our valued UAW workers."". White House officials have shown some openness to that sentiment, especially as Biden tries to boost domestic manufacturing and help U.S. companies compete with foreign competitors.  But some progressive Democrats have blasted the companies for taking in billions of dollars in taxpayer funds while rebuffing employees' call for more equitable pay. They have urged party leaders to take a more unequivocal stance behind the workers.  ""My belief is that the Democratic Party, from the president on down, need to stand in solidarity with Shawn Fain and the workers,"" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who added that Biden has been clear when he has spoken out on labor issues. ""There are not two sides to this issue. There is the issue of workers being paid fairly, especially after we have provided billions of taxpayer handouts and subsidies to the Big Three companies."". Biden, who often proclaims on the trail that ""unions built the middle class,"" has made selling ""Bidenomics"" a key piece of his reelection pitch. He has touted the Inflation Reduction Act, with its clean-energy tax credits for consumers and companies, as crucial to creating well-paying jobs and reviving America's manufacturing sector.",What is the stance of progressive Democrats on the wage demands of GM and Ford workers?,"Progressive Democrats support the wage demands of GM and Ford workers and have criticized the companies for refusing to provide more equitable pay.

5,"Myanmar's civil strife, which has dragged on for more than two years after the army ousted the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, and the South China Sea disputes were again expected to overshadow the Jakarta summit agenda, as in previous years. Indonesia tried to swing the focus to boosting regional economies with an upbeat theme this year — ""ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth"" — but the geopolitical and security issues have continued to pester and spark diplomatic fallouts.  The European Union has warned that its relations with ASEAN may be affected if it has to deal with Myanmar in any leadership role. Following the EU warning, Myanmar's military-led government, which has not been recognized by — but remains a member of — ASEAN, gave notice that it may not be able to chair the regional bloc as scheduled in 2026, two Southeast Asian diplomats told the AP.  ASEAN leaders would have to decide in Jakarta whether to ask the Philippines to replace Myanmar as host for that year, said the diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to publicly discuss the issues.  Myanmar could also not assume a three-year role starting next year as coordinator of ASEAN-EU relations, according to the two diplomats.  Myanmar's generals and their appointees have been barred from attending ASEAN's leaders and foreign ministerial meetings, including this week's summit meetings, after the military government failed to fully comply with a five-point peace plan that called for an immediate end to violence and the start of dialogue between contending parties, including Suu Kyi and other officials, who have been locked up in jail since they were overthrown.  About 4,000 people have been killed and more than 24,400 people arrested since the army takeover in Myanmar, according to the advocacy group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.  In a crucial reform that would allow ASEAN to respond faster and prevent such crises from degenerating into deadly disasters, its member states have discussed proposed rules that would allow the group to make a decision even in the absence of consensus from all member states, one of the two diplomats said.",How has the military-led government in Myanmar impacted ASEAN's relations and its role within the organization?,"The military-led government in Myanmar has had a significant impact on ASEAN's relations and Myanmar's role within the organization.

Myanmar was also set to assume a three-year role as coordinator of ASEAN-EU relations, but it will not be able to fulfill that role.

5,"China right now has excess capacity. The demand is not there, whether it is local demand or global demand for Chinese products. For a Chinese manufacturer, the only way to sell will be by making it more attractive, which is breaking the prices. Once local demand is not there and the acceptability for made in China products is not there, will this have a greater destructive impact and this could be a multi-year phenomenon? Yes, very fair point and this is actually happening for a lot of popular export destinations for India like Latin America, Southeast Asia, but we need to see China on a global level also. It has trade tensions with a lot of countries. If we take the US-China trade, the US has imposed a lot of import duties in the range of 20-30% on the import of chemicals from China.  The US demand is moving towards a new supply source and India is coming out to be the most reliable partner for a country like the USA. Similarly, a lot of Southeast Asian companies faced trouble from Chinese suppliers immediately after Covid. So China, although is the cheaper, undercutting supplier, it is not the most reliable supplier.  So for that part, the secondary supplier comes out to be India. That is giving India some limelight in the Asian market which used to be the popular Chinese destinations for export. Another market where India is trying to expand its base beyond agrochemicals is the Latin American market. The Latin American market is an underdog when it comes to personal care, home care chemicals, construction and chemical segments. Indian companies mainly focus on agrochemicals. India and Brazil are going to have a new FTA in place by year end. That will further boost the export of speciality chemicals and commodity chemicals from India to Latin America. Overall, the China price erosion phenomena will slowly die down towards the end of this fiscal year by Q4.",What factors are leading to China's loss of attractiveness as a supplier and creating opportunities for India in global markets?,"China's loss of attractiveness as a supplier is due to several factors. First, China currently has excess capacity and a lack of demand for its products both domestically and globally. Second, trade tensions with other countries, such as the US, have led to the imposition of import duties on Chinese products, prompting countries to seek alternative supply sources. Third, Chinese suppliers have faced reliability issues, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, making them less dependable. As a result, India is emerging as a more reliable and attractive partner for countries like the US, Southeast Asian nations, and Latin American markets. India's reliability as a supplier and its focus on sectors beyond agrochemicals, such as personal care, home care, and construction, are creating opportunities for India to expand its presence in global markets. Additionally, India and Brazil are set to have a new Free Trade Agreement in place, further boosting the export of chemicals from India to Latin America.",0498aa4aa7c8898d8a0707c6160ce422

How quickly are the roads available, so emergency vehicles can get in and people can get back to their homes, so that you're not just sort of, like, running around trying to figure out whatever is the shiny object or the dumpster fire you're trying to take care of, but you have a clear plan and a clear focus.

DODSON: Well, Neil, maybe I'm idealistic about it, but I think, in the end, Americans are smart.  And they can see that there are some people who are really good at getting things done and some people who just are not very good at getting things done. And talk only lasts so long. And so I think, if you see a -- for example, a Biden administration that's working with DeSantis and they're getting things done, there's -- fine.  There's credit for everybody.

Dozens of cranes lift blocks weighing several tons and drop them to compact the soil of a roughly one-square-mile area on Peru's Pacific coast, part of China's most ambitious port project in Latin America designed to facilitate trade between the regions. CHANCAY, Peru -- Dozens of cranes lift blocks weighing several tons and drop them to compact the soil of a roughly one-square-mile area on Peru's Pacific coast, part of China's most ambitious port project in Latin America designed to facilitate trade between the regions.  The port of Chancay, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of the Peruvian capital of Lima, will be ""the gateway from South America to Asia,"" said Mario de las Casas, institutional affairs manager of COSCO Shipping, a Chinese state-owned company that is the majority owner of the project.  De las Casas said the $1.3 billion project will offer a direct route to China with a travel time reduction for ships of 10 days. COSCO officials say ships traveling from South America to China normally take more than 45 days with stops in Central America, Mexico or the United States.  Offering a deep water port, Chancay will be able to handle container ships that can't dock elsewhere in South America.  De las Casas said the port is part of China's Belt and Road Initiative. ""China has been investing in infrastructure and logistics around the world for years. There are ports in Greece, in Spain, in Africa, all over the world."". Isaac B. Kardon, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace - who has researched China's maritime affairs - estimated that as of July 2020 there were at least 95 ports in the world operated in whole or in part by Chinese capital.  Kardon, formerly an adjunct professor at the U.S. Naval War College's China Maritime Studies Institute, said ""Chancay is a strategic investment for COSCO, China's largest and most globally competitive state-owned shipping company."".",What is the significance of the port of Chancay in Peru in facilitating trade between South America and Asia?,"The port of Chancay in Peru is significant in facilitating trade between South America and Asia because it will serve as ""the gateway from South America to Asia."" According to Mario de las Casas, the institutional affairs manager of COSCO Shipping, the Chinese state-owned company that owns the majority of the project, the port will provide a direct route to China, reducing travel time for ships by 10 days. It will also be able to handle container ships that other ports in South America cannot accommodate. This will enhance trade connectivity and promote economic exchange between the two regions.",1180b60a2755fa867a2279a2fb9e8839

5,"Some advice,"" Aug. 27. I read with great interest your article concerning solar, as I am currently in the process of having a system activated at my home.  Unfortunately, I did not contract for the project before April 2023 and am therefore bound by the net-metering plan that reduces the power buyback credit by 75%. This disincentivizes many homeowners from installing solar.  Furthermore, California does not provide a rebate or tax credit, and the federal tax credit (currently as much as 30% of the system cost) expires in 2032. If our federal and state governments truly want to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, they must create better incentive plans for homeowners to install systems that are very expensive.  Also, the permitting and inspection process is far too lengthy. I contracted on June 28, but the expected activation for my system is some time in November or December, even though the actual installation took less than one week.  The reason: large backlogs in permit applications and inspections. The government should provide special funding to staff the local departments that handle solar permitting and set standards for the electric companies to reduce their inspection and turn on time.  Currently, 42% of electricity generated in California is from fossil fuels. The faster each home solar system becomes active, the quicker we drive down demand for fossil fuels.  Frank Deni. Lake Forest. ::. Thank you for your timely and impactful special section on climate change. I appreciate being able to read in-depth reporting on a topic that should be on the front page of every newspaper every day.  The article on solar power options in California was informative and answered many of my questions. But one area that it did not address was the new federal grant program, Solar for All.  State and local governments can now (and California definitely should) expand their distributed solar initiatives by applying for a grant under this new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency program.  The program is part of the Biden administration's Justice40 initiative, meaning at least 40% of the program's benefits must reach low-income and disadvantaged communities.",What are some challenges and disincentives that homeowners face when installing solar power systems in California?,"Some challenges and disincentives that homeowners face when installing solar power systems in California include:
1. The net-metering plan, which reduces the power buyback credit by 75% for homeowners who did not contract for the project before April 2023.

3. The expiration of the federal tax credit for solar systems in 2032.

Sitting pensively inside the makeshift shed that serves as his grocery shop, Florencio Okonyo explains how, for close to three decades, he has bought fresh vegetables and other household items at discounted prices before selling them for a slim profit to residents of Lindi village, part of Nairobi's sprawling Kibera slum.  When business was booming, Okonyo, 69, would take home ""one or two thousand Kenyan shillings"" (£5-£10), which was enough to feed, clothe and educate his four children.  Not any more. Dwindling supplies of fresh produce from Toi, the main market in Kibera, means he is unable to restock his stall. Today, only a few oranges, each selling for a paltry 5 shillings, are available; the proceeds are too meagre to feed the family.  High food prices have forced Okonyo to drop rice and milk from the family menu. Half a kilogram (17oz) of rice and 500ml (a pint) of milk sell for 60 shillings each.

5,"Portraying long-overdue representation as undue influence is disingenuous.  The falsity underlying ""coercion"" smears is that China exploits asymmetric economic ties for political gain. In reality, larger trade shares reflect market-driven optimizing of comparative advantages, not deliberate dependence. Claims that beneficial trade gives China coercive leverage ignore that any disruption would inflict self-harm. Interdependence is a mutual vulnerability, not one-sided control.  Seeking to contain China's rise, Western elites find it expedient to spin reciprocal economic exchange as coercion and domination. This masks their own trampling of sovereignty through lopsided institutions and menacing sanctions. It aims to deny agency to developing nations pursuing win-win engagement. Ultimately, it attempts to sabotage promising routes for common prosperity.  But transparently contrived vilification only injures its propagators' credibility.

5,"You can guess what it is about.But I have also had to take a breath for a week or two to manage my own emotions, because what I have learned in the last few weeks is so very devastating, regarding the plans of the evildoers of our moment, to destroy, or restrict severely the powers of humanity, via destroying babies and human fertility.We learned in DailyClout's Report 69 that Pfizer knew that they were killing babies in utero and that they knew they were making nursing newborns, born to vaccinated moms, severely ill. And they proceeded to urge this mRNA injection on pregnant women. As did The New York Times (which, I gather, is running a hit piece on me shortly, surely coincidentally). As did Dr Rochelle Walensky, who told all the pregnant women in America to get an mRNA injection three days after Pfizer concluded that it was a factor in the aborting of two babies.The first tranche of the Moderna papers came out in July, due to another successful lawsuit by hero/lawyer Aaron Siri. And we learned that Moderna, too, had been experimenting on destroying the fertility cycles of female mammals.So the goal – at least one primary goal – of all of this madness and evil of the past three years, whatever brand you chose, was to ruin women's menses and to damage human reproduction at a global level. Team Pfizer or Team Moderna? A distinction without a difference.And now the PR campaign for ""the new variant"" is on – predictably, as the advisory group for the FDA recommended in advance of their even existing, that future boosters for variants should be approved – and the AI that now rules journalism, is pushing out scary stories on schools that are sending kids home, on universities such as Rutgers that won't allow students back on campus unless they are injected with this new formulation with its lack of longterm double-blind safety data – on the return of masks. All of this is entirely connected to the 89% drop in manufacturing demand that Pfizer reported and the tanking of Moderna's share values.[1] Why pause the gravy train? Dead babies be damned.",What devastating information has the author recently learned regarding the plans of evildoers and their impact on human fertility and the health of babies born to vaccinated mothers?,"The author has recently learned that Pfizer and Moderna were aware of the harm their mRNA injections could cause to babies in utero and nursing newborns born to vaccinated mothers.

5,"This recognition has generated considerable goodwill. One example is in the way the UAE, through the Emirates Red Crescent, provided humanitarian support to the Philippines in many instances, such as Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, the eruption of the Taal volcano in 2020 and the provision of equipment and medical aid at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.  A little over two months ago, during the Philippine's National Day celebrations, the UAE sent 50 tonnes of relief goods, food and medicine for the impending eruption of Mayon volcano. What is significant about this gesture is that even before the need arose, the UAE already made provisions. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, thanked Sheikh Mohamed in a letter and they also spoke on the phone, further discussing ways forward. It was also during this phone call that Mr Marcos accepted Sheikh Mohamed's invitation to attend the Cop28 environmental summit that the UAE will host this year.  On labour, which has long been the primary basis of our strong relations, in 2021 we broke new ground with the third Joint Committee Meeting on Bilateral Labour Co-operation. More recently, I had a meeting with Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation where the UAE indicated strongly that it needs more Filipino workers across a wide range of sectors. A bilateral agreement on combatting human trafficking was signed in September 2019, and a deal on consular co-operation was signed in April 2021 – both are important agreements that ensure mechanisms are in place to protect the rights and welfare of Filipinos in the UAE.  On the back of this solid foundation, many Filipinos in the UAE have built on the opportunities given to them, and made the transition from employee to entrepreneur, becoming business owners through sheer determination, hard work and faith. I have come across many such success stories and had the privilege of meeting several them. They are truly remarkable and an inspiration to all.  What will surprise most people is that in the past 15 months alone, we signed three important agreements between our two countries on space co-operation, on agriculture and on investment promotion and protection. The two countries are also finalising an MoU that will bolster co-operation in a number of areas, including artificial intelligence.","What are some examples of the UAE providing humanitarian support to the Philippines, and what agreements have been made between the UAE and the Philippines in various sectors such as labor, consular cooperation, and investment promotion?","The UAE has provided humanitarian support to the Philippines in various instances, such as providing relief goods, food, and medicine during the eruption of the Mayon volcano.

5,"Progress on climate goals inadequate, targets need to be more ambitious: UN. New Delhi: Sending a strong message just ahead of the G20 leaders' summit, the UN climate body on Friday said that there is a rapidly closing window to raise ambitions in order to limit warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, and ""progress is still inadequate"" based on the best available science. It pitched for peaking global emissions by 2025 and cutting emissions 43% by 2030 from 2019 levels to close the gap. In its synthesis report to the first ever global stocktake (GST), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), said global emissions are not in line with desired goals and countries urgently need to set more ambitious targets in order to reduce global GHG emissions further by 60% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels, and reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 globally—a prerequisite to save the world from the disastrous consequences of climate change such as extreme weather events, food crisis, desertification and biodiversity loss. .  In a clear signal to G20 leaders, specifically the oil rich nations who have so far resisted the move to cut fossil fuel use, the technical report of the UNFCCC on first GST also recommended ""scaling up renewable energy"" and ""phasing out all unabated fossil fuels"", saying these measures are ""indispensable elements"" of just energy transitions to net zero emissions. The GST was designed under the Paris Agreement to assess the global response to the climate crisis and chart a better way forward. It is held every five years and is intended to inform the next round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs)—climate actions—to be put forward in 2025. The report lays a strong scientific and technical base for the conclusion of the first global stocktake in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, at the 28th session of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) during November 30-December 12.","What are the recommended measures to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and limit the effects of climate change, according to the UNFCCC's synthesis report?","According to the UNFCCC's synthesis report, the recommended measures to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and limit the effects of climate change include peaking global emissions by 2025, cutting emissions by 43% by 2030 from 2019 levels, reducing global GHG emissions by 60% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels, and achieving net zero CO2 emissions globally by 2050.

We got the viewing figures from the debate: almost 13 million people, you know, way short of the 24 million who watched the first Republican debate in August 2015, the last one in which Trump appeared. But given, you know, audience fragmentation since then and the fact that Trump wasn't there, it's still a lot more viewers than people expected.

5,"New chapter in trilateral relationship has begun. By Ahn Ho-young. The leaders of the Republic of Korea, Japan and the United States convened at Camp David on Aug. 18 for a trilateral summit. The three leaders agreed to strengthen their respective economies, support the free and open international order based on the rule of law, and bolster regional and global peace and security. The three leaders wrapped up their joint statement by declaring that ""a new chapter in our trilateral relationship has begun."" I wholeheartedly agree with that statement.  It is time for a new chapter in the trilateral relationship. In the past 70 years, the rules-based liberal order offered a stable international basis for industrialization, democratization and national development in various areas for a large number of countries. That order is being seriously challenged around the world. For that reason, today has been defined as a pivotal point in history in the joint statement: ""a hinge point of history, when geopolitical competition, the climate crisis, Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, and nuclear provocations test us."". As the joint statement states, ""This is a moment that requires unity and coordinated action from true partners."" That in fact is the reason why the U.S. has been promoting mini-lateral cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, such as Quad and AUKUS (Australia, the U.K. and the U.S.). One region where such regional cooperation is badly needed is Northeast Asia. For that, we had to overcome a long-standing barrier; the bilateral relations between Korea and Japan, fraught with issues of history. President Yoon took important steps in that direction through a series of courageous moves. His moves led to appreciable rapprochement in relations between Korea and Japan, which made it possible to usher in a new chapter in the trilateral relationship.  It's a new chapter in our trilateral relationship, because the three leaders committed themselves to significantly enhancing the trilateral partnership for security.","What did the leaders of South Korea, Japan, and the United States agree to during their trilateral summit at Camp David, and why is it considered a new chapter in their relationship?","During the trilateral summit at Camp David, the leaders of South Korea, Japan, and the United States agreed to strengthen their respective economies, support the free and open international order based on the rule of law, and enhance regional and global peace and security.

5,"Meeting these ambitions will be challenging but achievable. There are actions we can take that we know will work, such as reducing deer numbers to allow our native woodlands to regenerate naturally.  Protecting more of our land for nature will provide bigger areas of natural habitats for species to move across and to create conditions that species can move into.  Our farm funding system can be made fairer for farmers and crofters while supporting them to adopt nature- and climate-friendly methods of food production. The solutions are on the table and it is up to our political leaders to have the vision to champion them.  Earlier this month the leaders of Scotland's nature charities wrote to all Scottish party leaders calling for renewed commitment to tackle the climate and nature crises.  We hope that the imminent publication of the Biodiversity Framework marks the start of a more consensual approach to environmental policymaking and the resumption of the cross-party consensus that has driven previous successes, such as our climate targets.

Chinese state oil companies China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec), PetroChina and CNOOC rank near the bottom on a gauge of climate pledges made by the world's largest oil and gas companies, just above Saudi Aramco, according to a report by Carbon Tracker.  The London-based independent think tank's Absolute Impact 2023 report, released on Thursday, assessed and ranked the emissions-reduction commitments of 25 of the world's largest listed oil and gas companies.  The report warned that the companies have no plans in place to reduce production by amounts sufficient to comply with the Paris Agreement goals that aim to limit human-induced global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

But along with that there's a lot on the table to discuss, and if there is no joint statement, which we're hoping for, but there's a likelihood that will not come through over the next 48 hours with the G20 leaders on the table, it could be seen as a setback for the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has made the G20 a primary focus around which he's been talking to the media and promising so much that he can deliver as the rotating presidency of the G20 summit.

5,"Biden's unpopularity could give Trump his shot at reclaiming power. (CNN) — The devastating verdict voters deliver on President Joe Biden in a new CNN poll is especially stark ahead of the most unprecedented election in modern times. Fourteen months before his fate is decided, Biden's unpopularity may be brewing the only possible conditions in which a disgraced and anti-democratic ex-president, who might be a convicted felon by Election Day, would be able to squeeze back into power.  It begs the question of how GOP front-runner Donald Trump, whose administration was a four-year cacophony of chaos, scandal and fury, and who tried to cling to power after losing the 2020 election, could be locked in a statistical tie (47% to 46% among registered voters) with Biden after facing 91 criminal charges across four cases.  The chief rationale behind Biden's bid for a second term is that he is the best positioned Democrat to beat Trump again. But unless political conditions change significantly in the coming months, that narrative may be in doubt.  If the president goes on to lose reelection to Trump - or any other Republican - the warning signs contained in the CNN poll, which mirrors his troubles in other recent surveys but goes far deeper on reasons for his malaise, will have foreshadowed the story of his downfall.  The survey, conducted by SSRS and released on Thursday, paints a picture of a pessimistic and divided nation that is far from experiencing the return to normality that had been promised in 2020 by Biden - a president the country finds neither inspiring nor worthy of confidence.  Biden has frequently been underestimated. And a national poll so far ahead of an election that will be won in a handful of tight battleground states can never predict how it will turn out. There's an added caveat in 2024: Trump's multiple looming trials could reshape the electoral terrain significantly. . Biden's deep political challenges . Yet the findings nevertheless pose dilemmas that Democrats have so far been unwilling to confront. They include the question of whether an 80-year-old president with a 39% approval rating is really the party's strongest bet for next year's election.",What does a recent CNN poll suggest about Biden's popularity and his chances of winning reelection against Donald Trump?,"According to a recent CNN poll, President Joe Biden is facing unpopularity among voters. The poll shows that Biden's approval rating is at 39%. The poll also indicates that Biden is in a statistical tie with former President Donald Trump, who faced 91 criminal charges across four cases, with both candidates receiving 47% and 46% of the registered voter support, respectively. The poll suggests that unless there are significant changes in political conditions in the coming months, Biden's narrative of being the best-positioned Democrat to beat Trump again may be in doubt. The poll paints a picture of a divided nation that is pessimistic and does not find Biden inspiring or worthy of confidence. However, it is worth noting that national polls conducted far ahead of an election may not perfectly predict the outcome, especially considering that Trump's pending trials in 2024 could reshape the electoral landscape.",057fa767a0168a78f836ce849735dec5

""It is hard to see whether there will be any meeting and if there will be any breakthrough.  ""Both sides need to talk as the G20 meeting is to be held. Unless there is some breakthrough, shaking hands would be cosmetic."". Experts say re-establishing ties between India and China will benefit the bloc amid talks of an expansion of the Brics group.  However, there has been no word from the respective governments on the leaders holding bilateral talks on the sidelines of the summit.  Expansion. Brics was formed as an informal group in 2009 to provide a platform to its members to challenge a world order dominated by the US and its western allies. The bloc was the formalisation of an idea by London investment banker Roopa Purushothaman in 2001, who coined the term when preparing a report for Goldman Sachs.  With the continuing Ukraine-Russia war, sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West and the shift in the geopolitical order, the potential significance of the bloc has increased, particularly for Russia and China.  More than 40 nations including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia have expressed an interest in joining.  But the members are divided over an expansion.  Russia and China, which are looking at increasing their influence to counter the US, support a wider membership.  Mr Ramaphosa, too, has backed the expansion, saying ""a larger body would represent a diverse group of nations that share a common desire to have a more balanced global order"" in an ""increasingly complex and fractured"" world.

We'll have to see how it plays out in the next several weeks with Republicans obviously they're going to continue to hammer the administration on just what Iran is going to be able to do with this money.  Of course, the administration has said repeatedly, it will not be going straight to Iranian coffers. It is going to be monitored closely by Qatar. The Republicans are unlikely to buy that, however. So how Iran uses these funds that is something that will be closely watched here, Max.  FOSTER: Do you think President Biden will address a lot of that when he speaks about this publicly?. BERTRAND: It's certainly possible. The administration has been saying publicly in multiple statements over the last several weeks since the news broke that this deal was in the works, that this $6 billion is the most controversial aspect of this. And they understand that and they have been trying to clarify that this is not Iranian.  This is not U.S. taxpayer money, it is Iranian money. And so expect the President if he does make some kind of statement on this, to emphasize that these are Iranian funds, and not something that of course, the U.S. taxpayer is going to be footing the bill on, Max.

5,"She was applauded by the audience, but the fact that most of the attacks on Ramaswamy came from the two most unpopular candidates made him even stronger. Ramaswamy seemed to enjoy drawing the spotlight and putting on a show. And the U.S. media hailed him as the winner of the debate.  Haley, the only woman in the Republican race, scored points with her practical and rational messages, calling for a basic consensus on abortion and showcasing her foreign policy expertise. But foreign policy does not win elections. Sen. Tim Scott, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson made little impact.  Pence left the debate having achieved his goal of explaining to the Republicans that he had no power to annul Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential elections, as Trump requested, without violating the Constitution. Ramaswamy did not comment, but DeSantis, Burgum, Haley, Scott and, above all, Christie, expressly acknowledged this.  Christie was the most critical voice of Trump. He argued that regardless of whether the criminal charges against the magnate are justified or not, Trump's ""conduct is beneath the office of president of the United States"" — a comment that was booed by the audience. Christie fulfilled his objective, but he doesn't have the slimmest chance of winning the Republican nomination with that message, which ignited the debate in the scant quarter of an hour dedicated to the former president.  Trump came out of the debate unscathed. At the same time that the debate began, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson laid out the red carpet for him in a friendly pre-recorded interview that, as of Thursday morning, had been watched 200 million times on X, formerly known as Twitter. In the interview with the controversial presenter, Trump said he had no interest in getting ""harassed by people that shouldn't even be running for president.""

5,"I mean, it's pretty much already forgotten.  So for the party, I mean, we heard in the debate Ron DeSantis say directly that if the next election is about the insurrection Republicans could lose, but how will that be possible? I mean, is it more likely as one of our reporters put it that the defining moments of or more likely to happen in the courtroom than on the campaign trail?. BROWNSTEIN: It is possible. Look, if Donald Trump is the nominee of the Republican Party, he is going to be competitive for the White House because we, you know, we are at an intense level of polarization, very few people switch sides from the team that they usually identify with, and we are a closely divided country.  Plus there's a lot of hesitation about giving Joe Biden another four years. Americans remain down on the economy, uneasy about inflation, and most people believe that he is too old to do this job for another four years. So all of that argues for a competitive race, no matter who the Republican nominee is. But Donald Trump fell seven million votes short last month. He is the one who has to expand his coalition.  And if you look at the way independent voters, as opposed to Republican voters, are responding to all of the legal challenges that are accumulating against him, it clearly raises the question of whether any of this is going to help him broaden the support that he had last time.  He can't forget he is the one who needs more votes if there is a rematch. And there's a lot of reason to think that while this would not crater his support, it would lower the ceiling at least somewhat and leave him in a more difficult position than he was last time.

5,"(AP). He may be getting a mugshot just like everyone in Georgia, but it would be an unprecedented event for him to go to jail.  There are some cases of high-profile figures facing consequences for their actions during criminal prosecutions.  Last week, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried had his bail revoked for allegedly trying to tamper with witnesses ahead of his upcoming fraud trial.  US District Judge Lewis Kaplain found probable cause that the former cryptocurrency billionaire harassed his former girlfriend, FTX executive Carline Ellison, by sharing her private journals with The New York Times. The entrepreneur was under court order restricting his internet and phone use, but allegedly continued speaking with journalists and contacted the general counsel for FTX.  Prosecutors argued Mr Bankman-Fried sharing the journals was a ""means of indirect witness intimidation through the press."". His lawyers have appealed.  The 31-year-old was previously under house arrest on $250m with his parents in California.  Even if Mr Trump did listen to prevailing lawyer wisdom and refrain from the non-stop verbal assault on his legal counterparts, the former president's looming public persona still presents a host of problems, including jury selection.  The ideal juror is open-minded and fair, without excessive awareness or opinion on the person and alleged crimes at hand. Good luck finding that after decades of the Donald Trump show.  ""Without the kinds of statements he's making, I think it is going to be a nightmare for the courts, the judge, to be able to find twelve jurors who can hear the case with an open mind and be fair-minded and make the decision solely on the basis of the evidence at the trial,"" Professor Dressler said.  ""Forget what Trump has said,"" he continued. ""All you have to do is read the newspaper…You're getting all kinds of information which hasn't yet been introduced at trial. That's going to make it very hard."". The ideal juror in this case, he said, is someone who has ""been living in a cave."". However, such a person is hard to find in Trump's America.  As Mr Trump's formerly lawyer Ty Cobb recently said, it's hard to hide from the former president.","What was the basis for Sam Bankman-Fried's bail being revoked, and what potential challenges might arise during his upcoming fraud trial due to the publicity surrounding his case and his connection to the press?","Sam Bankman-Fried's bail was revoked based on allegations that he attempted to tamper with witnesses ahead of his upcoming fraud trial.

During his upcoming fraud trial, potential challenges may arise due to the publicity surrounding his case and his connection to the press. The former president Donald Trump's public persona, as well as the extensive media coverage and statements made by Trump, could make it difficult to find impartial jurors who can objectively assess the evidence presented at trial. The ideal juror in this case would be someone who has not been exposed to the media coverage and has an open mind, which may be challenging to find in Trump's America.",cce25436434e306906f901e9806b2000

MICHELLE TOH, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Chinese tech firms Baidu and SenseTime have just launched their answers to the ChatGPT craze, rolling out their A.I. bots today to the general public. The move marks a new milestone in the global A.I. race which is heating up.  Baidu for one is now letting all users get their hands on its platform which is dubbed Ernie Bot. The tool allows users to conduct A.I. powered searches, or carry out an array of tasks from creating videos to making newsletters to providing summaries of complex documents.  Now, the news sent Baidu's shares up immediately surging more than 3 percent in New York on Wednesday, and nearly 5 percent higher in Hong Kong on Thursday.  Baidu is among the first companies in China to get regulatory approval for this rollout. And it's the first to launch this type of service publicly, a source tells me.  Until now, Ernie Bot had been offered only to corporate clients or select members of the public who requested access through a wait-list.  Meanwhile, SenseTime which is an A.I. start-up based here in Hong Kong also announced the public launch of its own platform today. The company's stocks surged 4 percent in Hong Kong after the news.  Now Baidu has been a front runner in China in the race to capitalize on the excitement around generative A.I. The tech behind systems like ChatGPT or its successor GPT-4.

JOHN ALLOCCO, CHAIRMAN, HERNANDO COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS: Well, what we're seeing right now is fortunately we've had many high percentage of our community has heated the evacuation orders and they have left the areas where we expect to have storm surge, certainly concerned of the storm surge and how severe it will be.

5,"Mulling over the complexity of it all now seems like wallowing in a warm bath. When the reality appears, you are thrown in a cold river. The cells are dividing; a choice must be made. Swim on, or turn back? I felt the power and I hated and feared it, and I realised why so many men hate it too, and seek to control it.  In most of the UK, abortion is still a technically a crime. The 1967 Abortion Act does not legalise abortion; it excuses it if a doctor considers that pregnancy (before 24 weeks) poses a risk to the mental or physical health of the mother. (Northern Ireland is different, with abortion legal on demand to 12 weeks.) This teaches women that to access care they must construct a narrative that continuing the pregnancy would be damaging to mother or baby, or both.  Perhaps that's why I didn't want the clinic to share my data. Having reduced a complex experience into a just-so story once, I didn't want that story to be fed into a mass data system that could, I worried, one day be shared with the health division of Google, or the German drug giant Merck, or some other company. I saw my abortion as my story, and not one from which I was keen to permit any corporation, however modestly, to profit.  You emerge from this ordeal with a story you guard fiercely. This doesn't mean you don't tell it to others: it means you want absolute authority to tell the story as and when you see fit. It was months before I told my Texan family about the abortion; in the service of a wider point, I am writing about it now.  In German legal language, this is ""informational self-determination"", or informationelle Selbstbestimmung. This idea means something slightly different to me from privacy. Privacy connotes a turning away, a hiding. But I didn't want to hide my abortion: I wanted agency over when the story was told.

4,"While continued religious churn and other factors will also affect Singapore's future religious composition, the way in which current parents say they are raising their children suggests that Buddhists may continue to decline as a share of the overall population. Only two-thirds of Buddhist parents say they are raising their children as Buddhist; roughly one-quarter of Buddhist parents (27%) say their children are being raised with no religion. By contrast, much higher shares of Singapore's Muslim (99%) and Christian (90%) parents say they are raising their children as Muslims and Christians, respectively. And the survey finds that 85% of religiously unaffiliated parents are raising their children without a religion. Sidebar: Singapore's changing religious identity According to the national census, the religious makeup of Singapore today is markedly different from 40 years ago.10 Alongside rapid economic growth, the religiously unaffiliated have increased from 13% to 20% of the adult population. However, this period has also seen Christians roughly double as a share of the national population, from 10% in 1980 to 19% in 2020. After increasing between 1980 and 2000 (from 27% to 43%), Singapore's Buddhist population has since decreased to 1990 levels (31%). Meanwhile, the share of Singapore's adults who identify with Chinese traditional beliefs (including Taoism) decreased from 30% in 1980 to roughly one-in-ten in 2000 and generally has held steady since then.11 Since 1980, the percentages of Singaporeans identifying as Muslim, Hindu and other religions have remained fairly steady. Who are the people in Singapore who don't identify with a religion, and what do they believe? In stark contrast with neighboring populations in which nearly everyone claims a religious affiliation, roughly one-in-five Singaporeans do not identify with any religion – a group sometimes referred to as the ""nones."" Singapore's ""nones"" are overwhelmingly of Chinese descent and mostly college educated. By some measures, Singapore's religiously unaffiliated population does not appear very religious or spiritual.",What is the current religious makeup of Singapore and how is it expected to change in the future based on the religious beliefs of parents?,"According to the survey mentioned in the excerpt, the current religious makeup of Singapore shows that the religiously unaffiliated make up 20% of the adult population. Singapore's Muslim population is raising their children as Muslims at a very high rate of 99%, while Christian parents are raising their children as Christians at a rate of 90%.

What's happening with Democrats, not just in Atlanta, but also at the Department of Justice, and also at the New York attorneys general -- New York Attorney General Office is to prosecute the political opponents of the ruling regime, this is a very dark moment. It's a very serious thing.

Is this something that's going to move the needle?. BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: It could. It absolutely could. This could be a big deal. This law would require big companies, from banks, to oil companies, to big retailers, to disclose their scope one, two, and three emissions. And that last one, scope three, is the big one because that takes into account the entire value chain. If you're selling clothes, that's how much carbon it took to grow the carbon and then run the factories, and the dying, you know, facilities and all of that. If you're a bank, that means disclosing the carbon footprint of all your investments, which is 700 times greater than the direct emissions from keeping the lights on down at the bank.  So, a lot of opposition from this, from the chamber of commerce, from bankers, specifically. But companies like Apple are supporting this. Came out behind it here. And, of course, California's been on the vanguard, you know, since the '70s, of clean air laws, emission standards, and the country has been forced to keep up with that over time.  HARLOW: Yes, that is really interesting to see Apple's response, I mean what they're doing to try to become carbon neutral, what they're doing in Texas, et cetera, and the response of big oil. What is big oil saying about this bill? What can they -- how can they fight it?. WEIR: Yes, they're -- they're opposed. You know, the American Petroleum Institute and the lobbying group of this says this is way too complicated, it will - it will cost too much at the end of the day.",What would the passage of the proposed law requiring companies to disclose their emissions mean for big retailers and oil companies in terms of their carbon footprint?,"The passage of the proposed law would require big retailers and oil companies to disclose their scope one, two, and three emissions. Scope three emissions take into account the entire value chain, meaning companies would need to disclose the carbon footprint associated with their products and investments. This would have a significant impact on big retailers, as they would need to disclose the carbon emissions from the production process of their goods. For oil companies, it would mean disclosing the carbon footprint of their investments, which can be significantly larger than their direct emissions.

African leaders have called for debt relief across the continent to allow countries to get on with responding to climate change, as they publish the Nairobi Declaration at the end of the first African Climate Summit.  The declaration, which had a heavy focus on climate finance, also included a call for global carbon taxes, and for increased representation of African and other countries in the governance of multilateral banks.  But delegates and campaign groups were critical of the spotlighting of climate finance across the event which, they said, comes at the expense of issues such as adaptation and climate insecurity, at a time when extreme weather events across the continent have disrupted livelihoods, prompted displacement and worsened food insecurity.  ""Many communities bearing the brunt of increasing floods and droughts, while also at risk of conflict, are disappointed there wasn't more emphasis on ensuring that green investments trickle down to them,"" said Nazanine Moshiri, a climate, environment and conflict analyst for Africa at the International Crisis Group.

4,"Saudi nuclear program can be secretly managed - top Israeli sources. Top Israeli sources have told the Jerusalem Post that there are secret technological ways to ensure that the Saudis do not misuse civilian nuclear items, which the US may give them as part of a three-way normalization deal, for military purposes.  Although there are no guarantees, because the issue is highly technical and there are issues to address regarding the Palestinians and highly complex politics, these technological fixes could be key to locking in a normalization deal between Riyadh and Jerusalem, under Washington's auspices.  There are at least two aspects to the Saudis request that Washington provide it with a civilian nuclear program as one major incentive for Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's (MBS) willingness to normalize relations with the Jewish state.  One aspect is a nuclear power plant for generating electricity. That is the easier one.  The harder one is whether the Saudis receive enriched uranium for their facility and how that uranium will be enriched going forward. Most importantly, would they receive the capability to enrich the uranium themselves locally, or would they just receive pre-enriched uranium shipped in from abroad?. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer in a PBS interview in late August did not dismiss outright the possibility of Israeli support for a Saudi Arabian civilian nuclear power program that includes uranium enrichment.  Dermer repeatedly warned that if the US does not give the Saudis something in the nuclear arena, MBS may get a nuclear program with even fewer restrictions from China.  Later, anonymous sources on one hand tried to water down Dermer's seeming license to sell a nuclear program to the Saudis, but on the other hand. said the government would not rule it out.  The big question Dermer and the anonymous sources left open was how involved the US would be in managing whatever the Saudis received and what kind of insurance policy Israel would have against MBS or some later ruler going rogue to try to transform a civilian nuclear program into a military one.  Former Shin Bet cyber official Harel Menashri said the better approach would be, ""Don't give the Saudis any ability to enrich uranium,"" and that any enriched uranium they receive should ""only be pre-enriched somewhere else."". What does an ""insurance policy"" mean in this context?. The 'digital backdoor'.","What are the concerns and considerations regarding the Saudi Arabian civilian nuclear program, specifically in relation to uranium enrichment and potential misuse for military purposes?","The concerns and considerations regarding the Saudi Arabian civilian nuclear program are related to uranium enrichment and the potential misuse of nuclear technology for military purposes.

4,"Black Sea Grain Initiative. As representatives of our respective countries, we are very aware that for import-dependent countries across the Middle East, Africa and other regions, food security is national security. All our leaders are grappling with the challenges of inflation, increasing household spending and global food insecurity. More than a year has passed since Russia began its illegal invasion of Ukraine, in clear contravention of international law.  Its actions were an unequivocal violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and integrity, rendering stark the challenge to international law and the principles of the UN Charter. Aside from the terrible damage and loss of life the conflict has wrought in Ukraine, it has intensified the global food security crisis. The UN and Turkey brokered the Black Sea Grain Initiative in July 2022 to help protect the world from the worst of the ensuing crisis precipitated by Russia's war, allowing shipments of Ukrainian grain and other foodstuff to exit ports in the Black Sea.  Since its establishment, the Black Sea Grain Initiative has enabled more than 32 million tonnes of grain to be exported from three Black Sea ports in Ukraine to 45 countries across three continents. It has supported the stabilization of global food prices, preventing over 100 million people worldwide from falling into extreme poverty and hunger. The Initiative has been crucial in addressing global food insecurity and for ensuring predictable supplies of food reach the most vulnerable countries. The leaders of our and other countries agreed in Hiroshima in May to work together and respond to the worsening global food security crisis, calling on all participants to fully implement the Black Sea Grain Initiative.  Despite this call, and the efforts of the UN and Turkey to salvage this initiative, Russia withdrew unilaterally from the deal last month, effectively ending the Black Sea Grain Initiative. With this decision, the world has lost a key instrument of addressing global food security, leading to a further increase in food prices. Russia's withdrawal shows that it does not regard the increase in food prices and the threat of hunger and famine as collateral damage of the war, but as tools to maximize its own exports of cereals and revenues. It is crucial that all countries reject this attempt. The consequences of Russia's withdrawal will be felt everywhere, but most acutely by those most vulnerable countries.",What is the Black Sea Grain Initiative and why is Russia's withdrawal from it significant for global food security?,"The Black Sea Grain Initiative is a program that was established in July 2022 to help address the global food security crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

This withdrawal is significant for global food security because it eliminates a key instrument that was addressing the crisis and will likely lead to further increases in food prices.

4,"leader's vow to do so during the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.  Beyond this, Fofack argued that Washington would need to fundamentally redefine economic relations with African nations that currently focus largely on ""the geopolitical lenses and commodities structures."". ""We should transcend that and see the continent as an investment opportunity, see the continent as a place where it can actually, through win-win investment relationships, reduce our vulnerability to less resilient supply chains,"" Fofack told Newsweek.  Doing so, he argued, would require a ""candid assessment of the economic and trading landscape"" that has emerged over the course of decades, one in which, for example, ""sanctions are no longer as effective as they used to be only 20-30 years ago."". And while Fofack too said BRICS had a number of obstacles to overcome before it could prove a sizable challenge to a U.S. dollar-dominated international trade regime, he argued that the increasingly globalized effort put forth by the bloc to conduct trade in local currencies could ultimately address some of the immediate financial challenges faced by African countries, such as liquidity constraints hampering the economic potential of the continent.  Washington could also be part of the solution, however, and Fofack argued that ""effective African engagement has become a necessity for U.S. global leadership."". He argued that projected growth for the continent may be such that the U.S. is ""forced to adjust"" its approach, especially as a growing number of African leaders ""no longer want to be part of this global arrangement whereby they can only integrate into the global economy as supplier of raw materials."" Increasingly, he said, they sought to establish their countries as hubs for manufacturing the kind of products and components composed of such materials, creating well-paying jobs that could, in turn, address the continent's unemployment crisis.  But Fofack said U.S. politicians and corporations alike would need to be pushed to realize the benefits of such an arrangement, as well as the opportunities lost as a result of the current approach, even with its lofty rhetoric.  ""The moment you say that you see yourself as the partner of choice, you won't make the right investment,"" he said.",What is the argument made by Fofack regarding economic relations with African nations and the potential benefits of a different approach?,"Fofack argues that Washington needs to redefine its economic relations with African nations by viewing the continent as an investment opportunity rather than solely through geopolitical and commodities lenses. He believes that through win-win investment relationships, the U.S. can reduce its vulnerability to less resilient supply chains and address the liquidity constraints that hinder Africa's economic potential. Fofack also suggests that African leaders are increasingly seeking to establish their countries as hubs for manufacturing products and components, which can create well-paying jobs and address the continent's unemployment crisis. Therefore, he asserts that effective African engagement is necessary for U.S. global leadership and that a different approach could lead to significant benefits for both sides. The evidence for this argument can be found in the excerpt where Fofack discusses the need for a candid assessment of the economic and trading landscape, as well as the potential for African countries to become hubs for manufacturing.",69cf07ddf3ca47780256e5b29bdc8177

""The ­adoption of AI and machine learning will also help us to ­analyse the demand and ­questions raised by our policyholders at our call centres, which will help us to improve our products and services,"" Lam said.  Prudential's competitors, such as Manulife, HSBC Life and virtual insurers including Bowtie Life and OneDegree, are also investing in technology to boost sales and make the claims process easier.  For example, HSBC Life invested more than US$20 million in technology in the city in 2022 and 2023, according to Edward Moncreiffe, the insurer's Hong Kong chief executive. The improvements included slashing the time required for reimbursing online medical insurance claims from five days to just five minutes, ­starting from May 1.  Local insurers' investments in technology and services aim to capture a share of a booming opportunity following the return of mainland visitors after the border reopened in January.

4,"Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK). BRUNHUBER: Just a few hours ago, the papal plane landed in the capital of Mongolia. Pope Francis began his visit to one of the world's smallest Catholic communities. Mongolia has a Buddhist majority and it's believed there are only around 1,400 Catholics living there.  This is the first time a pope has traveled to the huge country, landlocked by China and Russia. The visit could present a chance for the Vatican to improve relations with those two major powers.  South Africa has the most industrialized economy in the region and attracts millions of foreign nationals. Most migrant workers come from other parts of the continent and need reliable ways to send money home to their families.  This month ""Africa Insider"" meets one of the country's leaders in the international money transfer market, Mama Money.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE). MAYOWA KUYORO, PARTNER, MCKINSEY NIGERIA: The technology to connect a lot of our financial systems is still maturing. There are few companies that are helping to solve this issue of transfers on the continent. (INAUDIBLE) in Southern Africa, Nala, Mama Money.  MATHIEU COQUILLON, DIRECTOR, MAMA MONEY: I see fintech as a bridge to enable the people of South Africa and the continent at large to be able to become financially included.  My name is Mathieu Coquillon, co-founder and director of Mama Money, an international money transfer operation based in Cape Town, South Africa.  Motivation to start this business was to help migrant workers, who send small amounts of money home on a monthly basis, who pay ridiculous amounts of fees to be able to do that, to be able to do it using their cell phone, very simply at a low cost, less friction and so the money arrives home with their loved ones reliably and efficiently.  When we initially started, we went out and interviewed thousands of potential customers.","What is the purpose of Pope Francis's visit to Mongolia, and what potential impact could it have on relations with China and Russia?","The purpose of Pope Francis's visit to Mongolia is to meet with the country's small Catholic community, which is predominantly Buddhist. This is the first time a pope has traveled to Mongolia, and it is seen as an opportunity for the Vatican to improve relations with China and Russia, the two major powers that border the landlocked country. While the exact potential impact on relations is not stated in the excerpt, it suggests that the visit could present a chance for improved relations with these nations.",5b62fa9f450323a74fa111482c96bdd0
4,"I'd buy 10,000 shares of this growing penny stock to quadruple my money!. This surging penny stock combines my passions for film and finance into a soaring growth opportunity. Everyman ( LSE:EMAN ) operates a boutique cinema chain bringing premium viewing experiences to audiences across the UK. And with blockbusters lighting up screens, the future looks bright.    Crowd-pleasing numbers   This penny stock may be down 27% this year, but investors shouldn't rule out its potential just yet. Canaccord Genuity Group has a price target of £2 for Everyman shares. This indicates a potential gain of over 200% if the cinema chain continues to grow rapidly. .  Last month, Everyman enjoyed record weekly admissions fueled by smash hits like Barbie and Oppenheimer . This saw its July revenue jump almost 50% to £10.6m from £7.1m. But perhaps more encouragingly, its EBITDA doubled to £2.6m. .  With more crowd-pleasing films lined up for the rest of 2023, revenue and profits should continue to grow. The company is also rapidly expanding its footprint, as it's on track to open new upmarket cinemas this year and the next. As such, this penny stock is still in its early stages of growth.   Blockbuster offerings   Some sceptics are of the opinion that streaming will kill cinemas, which seems reasonable enough, but I disagree. Rather, I hold the view that after years cooped up at home, people crave communal, larger-than-life viewing again — and going out for a movie is an experience streaming can't replicate. .  This is even more true for an experience like Everyman. Its luxurious theatres feature spacious leather seats, premium food, and bars. This creates an exceptional viewing experience versus stale mega-chains — and its attendance last month proves the cinema's resilience. .  With the right slate, people are still flocking to cinemas for an immersive escape.","What factors are contributing to the potential growth of Everyman, the boutique cinema chain mentioned in the excerpt?","The potential growth of Everyman, the boutique cinema chain, is being attributed to several factors. Firstly, the company has experienced record weekly admissions and increased revenue, with July revenue jumping almost 50% thanks to crowd-pleasing films like Barbie and Oppenheimer. Additionally, Everyman's EBITDA doubled to £2.6m, indicating strong profitability. The company is also expanding its footprint by opening new upmarket cinemas, which further contributes to its growth potential. Furthermore, the luxurious and immersive viewing experience offered by Everyman, characterized by spacious leather seats, premium food, and bars, sets it apart from stale mega-chains and attracts audiences seeking a unique cinematic experience.",0ed013e174363a11ba26ce383d0450c0

He ditched that van late Saturday. He had stolen it earlier on Saturday from a dairy farm. That very area where he ditched that van behind a barn is the area that we're talking about, where we saw a ramped-up police presence a short time ago.  We can also tell you that the Pennsylvania State Police just moments ago issued a series of reverse 911 calls to all the residents in that area. I'm going to read you the contents of this reverse 911 call. Stand by here, calling it up.  This is from Pennsylvania State Police that says -- it says the Pennsylvania State Police are receiving reports of escaped convict, Danelo Cavalcante, in the area of Ridge Road, Coventryville Road, and Daisy Point Road in South Coventry Township, possibly armed with a weapon.  Residents in the area are asked to lock all external doors and windows, secure vehicles, and remain indoors. Please review your surveillance cameras and contact police. If you observe anything suspicious, if you see this individual, do not approach him, call 911.  Very significant there, Laura, because they are saying that Danelo Cavalcante possibly has a weapon. Up until this point, the police have not confirmed that he has a weapon. We have asked them repeatedly over the last week, do you have any indication that he has a weapon? They have said, no, we do not have any indication. This is significant. Not only a sighting, but that he possibly has a weapon on him, and it's in the area where he allegedly ditched that van on Saturday night.  This is the second confirmed -- well, basically the third confirmed sighting of him in the last 48 hours.","What actions are the Pennsylvania State Police taking in response to the escaped convict Danelo Cavalcante, and what is significant about the latest sighting of him in relation to the possible possession of a weapon?","The Pennsylvania State Police have issued a series of reverse 911 calls to all residents in the area where Danelo Cavalcante, an escaped convict, was last seen.

4,"Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran said digital transformation has been a theme around the world for at least a decade and now it's time to talk about AI transition.  He said India and many countries in Global South have problems providing access to services to their people.  ""An estimated 300 million lack access to services like healthcare, education and sometime ago for banking. On the other hand we have a lot of people looking for jobs. There are 10-12 million people coming to the workforce every year. We need to solve both problems. The only way to solve these problems is by adopting technology at scale that has never been done before,"" Chandrasekaran said.  He said that in the last 10 years, India has put in digital infrastructure through which it has been able to deliver service at scale with ease.  ""We have got to figure out a way of embracing AI in such a way that we can innovate faster and protect privacy,"" Chandrasekaran said.  Microsoft president and vice chairman Brad Smith said wherever he goes, people say that mistakes done in the case of social media should not be repeated in AI development.  ""I think it's fair to say that everybody, not just the companies that were involved in it, say the biggest social media sites, perhaps became a little too euphoric about the good thing that social media will bring to the world without thinking of the risks as well,"" Smith said.  He said the Arab Spring saw one side of social media and it was different at the time of the 2016 US Presidential election.  ""We need to be excited about the opportunity but thoughtful, perhaps even concerned about the downside and we need to construct guard rails from the outset as industry, as company and as governments and countries,"" Smith said.","What challenges are India and other countries in the Global South facing in terms of providing access to services, and how can AI help address these challenges?","India and other countries in the Global South are facing challenges in providing access to services like healthcare, education, and banking to their people, with an estimated 300 million lacking access.

That amount of money that the US is putting into their green energy transition as well as chips. It is nearly up to $1 billion, sorry $100 billion...  JENNIFER WESTACOTT:  A trillion.  SARAH FERGUSON:  A trillion dollars sorry, a billion here, a billion there, sorry. A trillion dollars, $370 billion for the green transition. Australia investment, we are already seeing investment going to the US. Australia can't compete in that environment so what does it do?. JENNIFER WESTACOTT:  It can't compete on measures like that, I mean it just can't but what we can do is make our whole economy perform better.  It is interesting, Mike Henry, the head of the BHP, he said when making investment decisions, he'll take getting the fundamentals right any day over a short-term particular policy initiative.  And I think that's the opportunity we've got to make ourselves this super attractive place for investment by getting our skills right. A lot of companies say to me it is the skills that we're looking for. Getting our industry policy right, getting it balanced, picking the things that we can scale up where we've got comparative advantage.  Making it easier to do business, getting our tax system working. If we can be that economy that people say, ""Australia is a fantastic place to invest, take risk,"" that is the best hope we've got of competing with that.  These are massive changes in the United States. I've just been there looking at it and I liken it to the clean energy equivalent of Roosevelt's new deal.  It will touch every aspect of their economy, it will transform it and in doing so, transform the world economy, but it is really now very urgent for us to say, ""Let's look at our investment environment. What action can we take to get investment going again?"".",How can Australia compete with the massive investment in green energy and chips by the US?,"Australia cannot directly compete with the massive investment in green energy and chips made by the US in terms of the amount of money invested. However, Australia can focus on making its economy more attractive for investment by improving its overall performance and getting the fundamentals right. This includes investing in skills development, formulating a balanced industry policy, scaling up areas where Australia has a comparative advantage, improving the ease of doing business, and optimizing the tax system. By becoming an attractive destination for investment and fostering a favorable investment environment, Australia can increase its competitiveness in the green energy sector. This aligns with the comments made by Jennifer Westacott, who emphasizes the importance of making Australia a ""fantastic place to invest"" to effectively compete with the US.

4,"The successor to Adam, called Eve, performs drug-discovery experiments and has more sophisticated software. When planning and analysing experiments, it uses machine learning to create ""quantitative structure activity relationships"" (QSARs), mathematical models that relate chemical structures to biological effects. Eve has discovered, for example, that triclosan, an antimicrobial compound used in toothpaste, can inhibit an essential mechanism in malaria-causing parasites.  Ross King, an AI researcher at the University of Cambridge who created Adam, draws an analogy between robot scientists of the future with AI systems built to play chess and Go. The prospect of machines beating the best human players once seemed decades away, but the technology improved faster than expected. Moreover, AI systems developed strategies for those games that human players had not considered. Something similar could happen with robot scientists as they become more capable. ""If AI can explore a full hypothesis space, and even enlarge the space, then it may show that humans have only been exploring small areas of the hypothesis space, perhaps as a result of their own scientific biases,"" says Dr King.  Robot scientists could also transform science in another way: by helping fix some of the problems afflicting the scientific enterprise. One of these is the idea that science is, by various measures, becoming less productive, and pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge is becoming harder and more expensive. There are several theories for why this might be: the easiest discoveries may already have been made, for example, and more training is now needed for scientists to reach the frontier. AI-driven systems could help by doing laboratory work more quickly, cheaply and accurately than humans. Unlike people, robots can work around the clock. And just as computers and robots have enabled large-scale projects in astronomy (such as huge sky surveys, or automated searching for exoplanets), robot scientists could tackle big problems in systems biology, say, that would otherwise be impractical because of their scale. ""We don't need radically new science to do that, we just need to do lots of science,"" says Dr King.  Automation might also help address another problem: the reproducibility crisis. In theory, when scientists publish their results, others can replicate and verify their work.","According to the excerpt, how could robot scientists potentially address some of the problems affecting the scientific enterprise?","Robot scientists have the potential to address some of the problems affecting the scientific enterprise by increasing productivity and reducing costs. They can perform laboratory work more quickly, cheaply, and accurately than humans, and they can work around the clock. This can help push forward the frontiers of knowledge by exploring a larger hypothesis space and potentially uncovering new scientific insights that humans may have missed due to their own biases. Additionally, robot scientists can contribute to large-scale projects in fields like systems biology that would otherwise be impractical for human scientists.

4,"6 attack. Griffin was the first official disqualified under the 14th Amendment in more than 150 years. The judge in that case determined that Jan. 6 was an insurrection for purposes of the Constitution, and that someone who helped to incite it — even if they had not personally engaged in violence — had engaged in insurrection and was disqualified. The stakes and the scale are larger in the Colorado case to remove Trump from the ballot, but the principle, the law and many of the facts are the same. . Importantly, academics and experts across the political spectrum have now concluded that Trump is disqualified under the 14th Amendment. They include prominent conservative legal thinkers like Professors William Baude and Michael Stokes Paulsen, and esteemed retired federal judge J. Michael Luttig, who wrote about the issue with Professor Laurence Tribe. This lawsuit in Colorado simply seeks to bring into practice what many of our top legal minds agree is already constitutional truth.  The fact that the lawsuit is being brought in Colorado is not an accident. The state's laws maximize the chance our plaintiffs will quickly get a fair hearing on this crucial constitutional provision. The state has a statutory provision requiring the secretary of state to exclude constitutionally ineligible candidates from the ballot and law providing for eligible voters to challenge in court improper presidential candidates. Those laws, along with the primary calendar and the presence of unflinching plaintiffs willing to bring the case, make Colorado the right place to start. Not every state has the necessary statutory regime to bring viable challenges to enforce Section 3, but Colorado will certainly not be the last state where such litigation is brought.  . Trump sought to keep himself in power after losing an election, ultimately inciting and encouraging a violent mob that attacked the Capitol. These are actions that more than meet the definition of engaging in insurrection. It is hard to imagine any conduct more dangerous to the survival of a democratic system of government than a leader refusing to leave, despite the people's votes against him, or resorting to force to hold on to power. Not holding such conduct accountable risks normalizing it — at which point we will have no democracy at all.","What is the basis for the disqualification of Donald Trump under the 14th Amendment, as stated by academics and experts?","The basis for the disqualification of Donald Trump under the 14th Amendment, as stated by academics and experts, is his involvement in inciting and encouraging the violent mob that attacked the Capitol on January 6th.

4,"There is only one way to overcome workers' fear of AI, says PwC's Tim Ryan. Since generative AI burst onto the business landscape last November, CEOs and other C-suite leaders have been trying to understand the impact the technology will have on their companies. Employees are worried AI will erase their jobs. It's up to C-suite leaders to bring employees along and provide the upskilling needed to make the most of AI.  As companies look to deploy generative artificial intelligence across their businesses, leaders run the risk of leaving the bulk of their employees behind. . That's a mistake that will cost companies dearly, according to PwC's Tim Ryan.  Since generative AI burst onto the business landscape last November, CEOs  have been trying to understand the impact the technology will have on their companies. Breathless interviews about generative AI's ability to do everything from supply chain management to customer service better, faster, and with fewer humans in the mix, have dominated the headlines.  Meanwhile, workers, still trying to recalibrate after the pandemic and the massive layoffs that occurred last year thanks to sky-high inflation and an uncertain economy, are wondering if AI will permanently erase their jobs. . Ryan said he's seen this cycle before. When he took over the top spot at PwC in 2016, the firm was in the midst of its own aggressive tech transformation. Workers, he said, were worried their jobs were going away as a result. He knew the only way to quell that worry was to train them on the new technologies PwC was using. . ""We taught our people how to use data analytics, bots, how to use visualization and we had massive success,"" he said. ""We made a commitment to our people not to leave them behind as long as they chose not to be left behind. Upskilling was very important because we were sensitive to what our people were feeling, and that was worry."" . AI as a job creator, not job eliminator.

In 2021, Intel announced a shift in strategy with the IDM 2.0 and the chipmaker strides towards reclaiming its position in the market by 2025. The chipmaker continues expansion in the Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) region with growing investments towards packaging facilities, foundries and research and development across the globe. Spearheading this revival is the Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, with India emerging as the fastest-growing market. Steve Long, Intel's General Manager for Asia Pacific and Japan, highlighted India's demographic advantage, encapsulated by its representation of 50 per cent of the global population. Speaking at the inauguration of the Intel Tech Tour in Malaysia, Long pointed out the country's dynamic growth in contrast to others facing stagnation and decline. ""APJ (Asia Pacific and Japan region) has a demographic advantage, I boil it down to having 50 per cent of the world population. India is growing, and its population is unlike other areas that are stagnant and declining,"" Steve Long, General Manager for Asia Pacific and Japan at Intel, said in a keynote during a facility visit in Penang, Malaysia. Long emphasised that this trend is clearly reflected in India's robust gross domestic growth, surpassing that of the rest of the world. He underlined that the region is shouldering the responsibility of driving innovation, underscoring its pivotal role in propelling global progress. Referring to India as an illustration and expressing Intel's perspective on the potential, Long indicated that the nation is the world's most rapidly expanding internet market, having gained 400 million new users following the Covid-19 pandemic. ""It is a massive change in the country. This is both a domestic consumption opportunity and an opportunity for India to change what they mean on the global stage. This is once in a generation kind of a thing,"" he further added. Long pointed out the attributes of India that contribute to the APJ region's distinction, including its diversity, demographics, and robust services industry.

The country's robust gross domestic growth surpasses that of the rest of the world, showcasing its potential. Furthermore, India is the world's most rapidly expanding internet market, with 400 million new users joining after the Covid-19 pandemic.

However, he was forced to cut a third of his staff in July as his campaign burned through funds.                       What are his flagship policies? Mr DeSantis gained popularity during the pandemic thanks to his anti-lockdown stance and his refusal to shy away from America's culture wars.  He has an impressive record-a star baseball player at Yale, as well as a graduate of Harvard Law School and a former Navy officer-but it is his anti-establishment approach that has won him a following among the GOP base.  Mr DeSantis has made his anti-abortion and anti-gun control stances clear during his time in power. In Florida he signed into law a controversial ""Don't Say Gay"" bill which restricts classroom discussion of sexuality and gender identity.  Some fear that he lacks the charisma and star power of Mr Trump. Nevertheless, supporters believe he offers a path to victory for Republicans after his landslide re-election in Florida, a critical presidential swing state, in November. .

However, in recent months he appears to have sharpened his rhetoric against the former president , having finally rejected his claims of election rigging in the 2020 election.

4,"Who lost Asia?. Ultimately, as tensions continue to mount in the Pacific, the Russian war has become an inescapable factor in a strategic equation that both precedes and surpasses it. The United States is obsessed with its rivalry with China – not with Russia or the future of Europe. It is supporting Ukraine on such a massive scale only because it knows that a Russian victory would give Beijing wings, perhaps encouraging it to be even more aggressive in the heated waters of the South China Sea or in Taiwan.  This debate is first and foremost a political one.  If that were the case, the American debate would not be about ""who lost Ukraine"" (as in 1949, after Mao's victory in Beijing, where the question in Washington was ""who lost China?""), but instead ""who lost Asia"", and thus the world.  It is in this complex and confusing context that a new debate on military aid to Ukraine has arisen. The debate is at times caricatural, as seen in Nicolas Sarkozy's ""Putinophile"" stance in France; or more strategic, in Washington's doubts about the Ukrainians' ability to shift the balance of power after the undeniably mixed results of their summer offensive.  However, this debate is first and foremost a political one, based in part on the Americans' initial analysis of the global impact of this conflict. In the highly inflammatory context of the U.S. election campaign, any setback in Ukraine would be interpreted as a gain for Xi Jinping's China, and therefore a failure for U.S. President Joe Biden.",How is the conflict between Russia and Ukraine connected to the United States' rivalry with China?,"The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is seen as a strategic factor in the United States' rivalry with China.

The China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development is dedicated to providing policy advice for environmental protection in China, and last year the CCICED focused on four major research topics.  From July last year to this August, the council carried out several policy research projects that involved global environmental governance innovation, national green governance, sustainable production and consumption, and low-carbon inclusive transformation, the 2022-23 annual work report of the council said.  One of the projects aimed to achieve the sustainable use and governance of oceans, with a particular focus on coordinating development of the blue economy. The project conducted in-depth research on plastic pollution prevention and control, and the sustainable transformation of fisheries. The research suggested integrating a sustainable blue economy into the national development strategy and promoting international scientific cooperation in support of a sustainable blue economy.  Another project focused on improving data quality in carbon markets including carbon emission trading and voluntary emission reduction. It conducted analysis and provided suggestions accordingly.  The council also researched the coordinated mechanism for reducing carbon emissions and pollution, and promoted green growth. It provided targeted policy advice on phasing out coal power, controlling heavy-duty vehicles and how emission reduction could promote economic growth.  One of the projects proposed improving institutional mechanisms and concrete solutions about issues faced by the Yangtze River Basin. In the context of climate change, regions along the river need to be protected by securing energy, sustainable agriculture and cross-regional environmental cooperation, the report said.  Another study identified key issues in land use, biodiversity, water and food security. Today, about 75 percent of the terrestrial environment and 66 percent of the marine environment have been severely altered by humans, the report said. Land degradation increases net greenhouse gas emissions, the loss of natural ecosystems, biodiversity and the vulnerability of marginalized populations, it added.  Other research stressed the need for sustainable development policies to guide the application of digital technology in urban development and climate adaptation. Globalization has deeply embedded in industrial and supply chains, and both producing and consuming countries should jointly promote building green supply chains, the report said.  Research suggested enhancing transparency, traceability mechanisms and building a green trade certification system.",What are the main research focuses of the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development and what policy advice have they provided?,"The main research focuses of the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development (CCICED) include global environmental governance innovation, national green governance, sustainable production and consumption, low-carbon inclusive transformation, sustainable use and governance of oceans, plastic pollution prevention and control, sustainable transformation of fisheries, improving data quality in carbon markets, reducing carbon emissions and pollution, promoting green growth, addressing issues in the Yangtze River Basin, land use, biodiversity, water and food security, and the application of digital technology in urban development and climate adaptation.

4,"""Constitutionally you'd have a pretty good argument that you would have to let him out while he's president,"" said Brian Kalt, a Michigan State University law professor whose 2012 book, ""Constitutional Cliffhangers: A Legal Guide for Presidents and Their Enemies,"" anticipated some of the current questions. He said one option could be the 25th Amendment - a constitutional fallback of last resort that allows a president ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office"" to be temporarily removed. That would still take action by the vice president, the Cabinet and Congress - a high bar.  Article continues below this ad. 6. If elected, could Trump be impeached again?. The double jeopardy clause of the 5th Amendment - which prohibits prosecuting anyone twice for substantially the same actions - doesn't apply to impeachment. So yes, in the event Trump wins the presidency, lawmakers could try once again to force his removal by accusing him of misconduct they consider to meet the constitutional standard of ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" As with Trump's first two impeachment proceedings, the House, by simple majority vote, could send one or more articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial. Trump's defenders would surely argue that his 2021 acquittal by the Senate, on a charge of inciting the insurrection at the Capitol, settled the issue. Regardless, it would remain difficult to achieve the bipartisan consensus necessary in the Senate to approve any article by the requisite two-thirds supermajority vote.  Article continues below this ad. 7. Does Trump have any constitutional defenses?. Among other possible defenses, including that Trump's false statements about the 2020 election were protected by the First Amendment, Trump's legal team has suggested that a former president can't be criminally punished for anything he did in office. Trump is ""immune from prosecution for acts that he takes in connection with those policy decisions"" he made as president, defense lawyer John Lauro told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" The Supreme Court has never addressed the issue directly. In another case involving Nixon, the Supreme Court held that the president is immune to civil lawsuits for any actions within the ""outer perimeter"" of his official responsibilities.","What constitutional options are there for temporarily removing a president unable to fulfill their duties, and what legal defenses could a former president have against criminal punishment for actions taken while in office?","One constitutional option for temporarily removing a president unable to fulfill their duties is the 25th Amendment. This amendment allows for the temporary removal of a president who is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."" However, this would require action by the vice president, the Cabinet, and Congress. As for legal defenses against criminal punishment for actions taken while in office, one possible defense is the argument that a former president is immune from prosecution for acts taken in connection with policy decisions made while in office. This argument suggests that a former president cannot be criminally punished for actions taken in their official capacity. However, the Supreme Court has not directly addressed this issue.",061c11e5ff0740e5583382496a7d4cd5

4,"I mean, I think that Ms. Rodgers actually articulated well the issues with this case and especially in light of the Supreme Court ruling. The fact is, I actually represented somebody for lying on an application about a year ago. And the difference between that case and Hunter Biden's case is he wasn't because he was an addict, it was because he was out on bond for alleged domestic violence and other things.  And so, that was a different type of issue and he ended up being sentenced and served. It was a plea deal of 18 months. That was a different set of issues than it is with Hunter Biden. I think the problem that Republicans have in trying to lift this up and trying to target Hunter Biden is two things. The first thing is that addiction touches nearly every family in this country. And we know Hunter Biden is an addict. And we know these charges are flimsy. And I think that most Americans will see through that. The second thing to charge this president's son with this bad behavior when you know individuals like Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr. actually pilfered Washington, D.C., manipulated and grifted their way through D.C. when they were in the White House with no accountability.

Three different counts of the Georgia vote, including one by hand, showed the ballots were tallied properly and the results were accurate.

Global food security is at crossroads as rice shortages and surging prices hit the most vulnerable. Francis Ndege isn't sure if his customers in Africa's largest slum can afford to keep buying rice from him.  Prices for rice grown in Kenya soared a while ago because of higher fertilizer prices and a yearslong drought in the Horn of Africa that has reduced production. Cheap rice imported from India had filled the gap, feeding many of the hundreds of thousands of residents in Nairobi's Kibera slum who survive on less than $2 a day.  But that is changing. The price of a 25-kilogram (55-pound) bag of rice has risen by a fifth since June. Wholesalers are yet to receive new stocks since India, the world's largest exporter of rice by far, said last month that it would ban some rice shipments. . It's an effort by the world's most populous nation to control domestic prices ahead of a key election year — but it's left a yawning gap of around 9.5 million metric tons (10.4 tons) of rice that people around the world need, roughly a fifth of global exports.  ""I'm really hoping the imports keep coming,"" said Ndege, 51, who's sold rice for 30 years.  ___.",What factors have contributed to the rise in rice prices in Kenya and the potential impact on vulnerable populations?,"The rise in rice prices in Kenya has been influenced by two main factors. First, higher fertilizer prices have affected local rice production, leading to a reduced supply and increasing prices. Second, a prolonged drought in the Horn of Africa has also affected rice production, further exacerbating the shortage and driving up prices. These factors have made it more challenging for residents in Nairobi's Kibera slum, who rely on cheap rice imports from India, to afford this staple food. The recent ban on rice shipments from India, due to domestic price control efforts, has created a significant gap in global rice exports, estimated to be around 9.5 million metric tons. This shortage adds to the challenges faced by vulnerable populations who rely on affordable rice as a food source.",b25d240377dccc7e817953e46904eb45
4,"Judge rules Giuliani liable for defaming Georgia election staff. Donald Trump's former lawyer Rudy Giuliani is liable for defaming two Georgia election workers who were the target of vote-rigging conspiracy accusations following the 2020 US presidential election, a US judge in Washington ruled yesterday.  US district judge Beryl Howell issued the order as a sanction against Mr Giuliani for failing to turn over electronic records sought by the two Fulton County election workers, Wandrea ""Shaye"" Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, in the case.  The judge found that Mr Giuliani had refused to comply with a process for producing records, known as discovery, and rejected the former New York mayor's argument that the election workers had used the lawsuit to harass him.  ""Donning a cloak of victimisation may play well on a public stage to certain audiences, but in a court of law this performance has served only to subvert the normal process of discovery in a straightforward defamation case,"" the judge wrote in her order.  Lawyers for Mr Giuliani and the election workers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Ted Goodman, a political adviser to Mr Giuliani, called the ruling a ""prime example of the weaponisation of the justice system, where the process is the punishment"".  Mr Giuliani argued in court filings that he had sought to turn over records, but faced several obstacles, including having his phone seized by federal agents in 2021.  Mr Giuliani is also facing criminal charges in Georgia's Fulton County for allegedly aiding then-president Donald Trump's effort to overturn his election loss in the state, including by making false claims about Ms Moss and Ms Freeman.  The judge's order means Mr Giuliani will have to pay damages for spreading false claims that Moss and Freeman secretly processed and counted batches of illegal ballots at a Georgia arena used to tabulate votes following the 2020 election. The pair said they received death threats and harassment after Mr Giuliani identified them by name.  Mr Giuliani previously admitted that his statements were false and damaged Ms Moss and Ms Freeman's reputations, but left open the possibility of challenging the claims on appeal.  He will now face a civil trial in federal court in Washington to determine how much he will have to pay. - Reuters",What was the ruling against Rudy Giuliani and what are the consequences he now faces?,"Rudy Giuliani has been ruled liable for defaming two Georgia election workers by a US judge in Washington.

William Burns told the US Senate Intelligence Committee that the CIA ""has to be much more creative and agile in defending our national security in the face of fierce technological competition from Beijing"". He added: ""We need to ramp up the collection, analysis and integration of intelligence on China.

He fought till the end, but the idea of fighting for global power might have given him a last rueful laugh at the absurdities of old age. The only office he deemed worth running for was his home office.  Gerontocracy rules, with the help of afternoon naps and a culture that still presents extremely old men as its best offer. Say all you like about the marvels of the third age and the optimism stemming from the fact that the Rolling Stones are threatening to tour their new album in their 80s. To see men who are older than the oldest person you know in such positions – in such outfits! – says that something is seriously amiss. My mum agrees.  It's hard to know what to make of it, or where it's going to end, but laughter is no longer the answer. In the 1980s, we had Konstantin Chernenko, leader of the Soviet Union for 13 months before it was realised that he could not perform his duties due to being already dead. His corpse had been embalmed and readied for Lenin's mausoleum, and then they made him general secretary.  We had Ronald Reagan, his mental order so weak that on ceremonial occasions he was instructed to simply copy what Nancy did. This went unnoticed until they took communion at the Vatican and Nancy accidentally dropped her bread into the cup of wine. Ronald copied Nancy and walked out smiling.  Reagan and Chernenko were both, when they left office, younger than Biden and Trump are now. Then as now, the laughter was grim, knowing that such men's tremulous fingers hover over the nuclear button.",What does the author criticize about the current trend of older men holding positions of power?,"The author criticizes the current trend of older men holding positions of power because it suggests that something is seriously wrong. The author mentions examples of older leaders, like Konstantin Chernenko and Ronald Reagan, whose mental and physical abilities were in question. This trend is seen as absurd and raises concerns about the ability of these leaders to effectively perform their duties, especially when important decisions, such as nuclear button usage, are at stake. The author suggests that laughter is no longer an appropriate response to this trend.",d38d6ff80996feb2462276a9ca731d12

Despite arriving at a cinema in downtown Beijing close to 10 pm one weekday, Guo Huijia, a 34-year-old office worker from Shanxi province, was surprised to find that almost 80 percent of the seats in the auditorium were occupied.  She decided to watch the crime thriller Lost in the Stars, the second-highest-grossing film in China's thriving summer movie season, after seeing a promotional video showcasing heartthrob actor Zhu Yilong, who plays the piano as part of his lead role.  ""When I walked out of the cinema at midnight, I couldn't help feeling a chill running down my spine. The movie tells a thought-provoking story that makes us reconsider the darkness within human nature, and serves as a warning to women in love,"" Guo said.  Due to her busy work schedule, Guo, a movie enthusiast, said she often goes to watch films late at night, mainly on weekdays. However, she noticed that in the past two months, the cinema she visited to watch Lost in the Stars had been consistently crowded.  As of Aug 31, box-office takings for the summer season, which started on June 1, had set a record by reaching 20.6 billion yuan ($2.75 billion).  The China Film Distribution and Screening Association and the live movie information tracker Beacon said more than 500 million cinema tickets were sold nationwide this summer at an average price of 40.80 yuan per person for the 35 million-plus screenings of the 138 films that were released.  Most industry insiders feel that the flourishing summer market shows that the domestic movie industry is recovering fast from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Yin Hong, deputy chairman of the China Film Association, said the summer frenzy, driven by a string of highly acclaimed and commercially successful blockbusters, rekindled Chinese audiences' desire to return to theaters, significantly boosting morale among domestic filmmakers.  This summer was the first time in months that students, who comprise a significant proportion of audiences during this season, had been able to visit cinemas without having to worry about pandemic prevention measures.",What factors have contributed to the successful summer box-office sales in China?,"The successful summer box-office sales in China can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the domestic movie industry is recovering fast from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has rekindled Chinese audiences' desire to return to theaters. Secondly, a string of highly acclaimed and commercially successful blockbusters have driven the summer frenzy, attracting a large number of moviegoers. Additionally, the ability for students, who make up a significant proportion of the summer audience, to visit cinemas without pandemic prevention measures has also contributed to the successful box-office sales.

Nikki Haley laid out her plan Friday to combat the Chinese Communist Party's infiltration of the United States. .  ""Our number one national security threat at this time is China , and literally, nothing is being done,"" Haley, a candidate in the 2024 Republican presidential primaries, said at The Gathering, an event at the Grand Hyatt Atlanta in Buckhead organized by radio host Erick Erickson. .  Haley, also U.N. ambassador during the Trump administration, painted a terrifying picture of the Chinese Communist Party's involvement in the land of the free and the home of the brave. .  ""They have bought 400,000 acres of U.S. soil,"" she said. ""They're putting millions of dollars into our universities to steal our research and spread Chinese propaganda."" .

4,"(""When unions win, Americans across the board win,"" says Biden.) Which is one reason why the AFL-CIO trade union, echoing Goldman Sachs, also hailed the act as a ""gamechanger"" for working people.  The passage of the legislation – all the more remarkable given a Senate then split 50-50 between the parties – and its impact are set out in an outstanding new book on the Biden presidency, The Last Politician by Franklin Foer. He describes how Biden, whose hands were already full with the Covid pandemic and the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, was not content simply to be a caretaker manager, troubleshooting crises. Instead, ""he set out to transform the country through some of the biggest spending bills that have ever been proposed"", Foer told me when we spoke this week.  The result is that Biden has ""redirected the paradigm"" of US economic life in a way that will affect Americans ""for a generation"". While Obama and Clinton were ""deferential to markets"", says Foer, Biden has reversed ""the neoliberal consensus"" in place since the Ronald Reagan era. He doesn't leave corporations alone; he gets stuck in, taking on de-facto monopolies, reviving ""anti-trust"" policies that had long been abandoned. (""Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism,"" insists Biden. ""It's exploitation."") ""Like Reagan, Biden is resetting the economic trajectory of the nation,"" adds Foer. ""In fact, as a matter of substance, he is the most transformational president since Reagan."". Internationally, the change is not as dramatic, but Biden is credited with bringing stability after the chaos and dictator-coddling of the Trump years and, especially, for building and maintaining a western alliance in support of Ukraine as it defends itself against Russian imperialism. Others admire his handling of China: robust, without crossing the line where a cold war turns hot.  There's more to the Biden record than this, of course. Inflation is not at European levels, but Americans are feeling the cost of higher prices.",How does the author describe Biden's approach to economic policies and its impact on the US?,"The author describes Biden's approach to economic policies as transformative and a departure from the neoliberal consensus that has been in place since the Reagan era. Unlike previous Democratic presidents who were ""deferential to markets,"" Biden is actively taking on de-facto monopolies and reviving anti-trust policies. He is not leaving corporations alone, but rather intervening to ensure competition and prevent exploitation. This paradigm shift in economic policy is set to affect Americans ""for a generation"" and makes Biden the most transformational president since Reagan. The evidence in the excerpt that supports this answer is the author's description of Biden redirecting the paradigm of US economic life and reversing the neoliberal consensus.",cd2fb58c8111afe1da6f98c60f17ba2a

4,"Money manager says you should consider these 3 small-cap growth stocks. For the last 10 years, large-cap stocks have outperformed small-cap stocks. So does that make small-caps a buying opportunity now?. Yes, says Bryan Wong, co-portfolio manager of the Osterweis Emerging Opportunity Fund , a small-cap growth stock fund. It has an annualized return of 6.69% for the five years through Aug. 25, compared to a 2.83% return for the Morningstar U.S. Small Cap Broad Growth Index.  Wong says that along with international stocks, small-cap is one of the most neglected asset classes. Small-cap stocks are thinly covered by analysts and provide an essential element of a diversified portfolio, he says. Wong particularly likes the healthcare and technology sectors.  We recently asked him for his latest views. Here they are, including three stock picks.   TheStreet: What's your investment philosophy?. . Bryan Wong: We're looking for exceptional small-cap growth companies that can graduate to mid-cap. We look for long-term performance, three to five years. We aim for 15% or better annual growth in earnings per share. We have a concentrated portfolio, with 30 to 40 positions. We have an absolute value discipline. We trim positions when values get elevated. .  TheStreet: What's the appeal of small-cap growth stocks?.  There's inefficiency in the small-cap market. Small-cap stocks have an average of four analysts covering each one. That number is 16-20 for large-caps. You get to see companies early. Also, these companies are the source of emerging innovation. . There's a creative destruction dilemma for innovation companies. Small companies innovate and then get protective over time, as they grow big. Also, the law of large numbers means it's difficult for companies to sustain their growth percentage over time.   TheStreet: Do you see small-cap growth stocks as an essential part of diversified portfolios?. . Wong: Absolutely. Along with international, small-cap is one of the most neglected asset classes.","According to Bryan Wong, why are small-cap growth stocks an essential part of diversified portfolios?","According to Bryan Wong, small-cap growth stocks are an essential part of diversified portfolios because they provide an element of inefficiency in the market and the opportunity to discover companies early on. With fewer analysts covering small-cap stocks compared to large-caps, investors have the chance to identify emerging innovation and potential opportunities for growth. Additionally, small-cap stocks offer the potential for higher growth percentages compared to larger companies, which may face challenges in sustaining their growth over time due to the law of large numbers.

4,". Daniel Flippo, director of the United Steelworkers southeast district, cautioned that community agreements might not have the teeth of union contracts.       . At a recent meeting with Energy Department officials about the electric vehicle transition, Mr. Flippo said, he told them, ""Look, all this going in to protect workers and worker rights looks good on paper, but if you don't follow up, it shouldn't be up to the union organizers to do it for you.""       . Democrats secured a raft of provisions in Mr. Biden's three signature laws to encourage labor organizing, raise wages and favor union apprenticeships and training programs. In May, the administration used those provisions to apply pressure to a Georgia electric bus company, Blue Bird, and support workers trying to unionize its Fort Valley, Ga., plant. The United Steelworkers won that vote.       .

4,"Why was Miami Mayor Francis Suarez ever  in the race for president?. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who declared his bid for the White House on June 15, promised he would drop out of the race if he didn't meet the Republican National Committee's fundraising and polling thresholds to qualify for the first Republican primary, which was held Wednesday in Milwaukee. Then he claimed that he had qualified for the debate but, as we all could see, he wasn't on the stage last week. Since then the question has been, Would Suarez persist with his vanity campaign or drop out, as he said candidates with support as anemic as his should do?. Would Suarez persist with his vanity campaign or drop out, as he said candidates with support as anemic as his should do?. We got our answer Tuesday, when Suarez posted on X, the platform formerly called Twitter, ""Running for President of the United States has been one of the greatest honors of my life,"" he wrote. ""While I have decided to suspend my campaign for President, my commitment to making this a better nation for every American remains,"" he added. With the suspension of his campaign, Suarez became the first Republican candidate to drop out of the 2024 race.  If some series of miracles had happened and Suarez had been elected president, he would have been the first Latino president of the United States, a goal Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, had when they ran in 2016. Rubio dropped out after he lost that year's Florida primary to Donald Trump. Suarez didn't even come close to Rubio's subpar performance. . Such an awful candidate had no business running for president. What made him so awful, you ask?. Let's start with the fact that not a lot of people have voted for him. Being mayor of Miami is not a powerful position and, sizewise, Miami (population 460,000 in 2020) is 19 times smaller than New York, eight times smaller than Los Angeles and six times smaller than Chicago. There's absolutely no evidence that Suarez can win broad swaths of support.",Why did Miami Mayor Francis Suarez suspend his campaign for president?,"Miami Mayor Francis Suarez suspended his campaign for president because he did not meet the Republican National Committee's fundraising and polling thresholds to qualify for the first Republican primary.

At Bank of New Hampshire, Carter hopes its sustainable debit card sets an example that other banks will want to follow. But he knows it won't be that simple. Bank of New Hampshire was also an early adopter of contactless cards in the U.S.; it offered contactless debit cards in 2009. It took nearly a decade - and the combined impact of EMV-chip cards, Apple Pay and a global pandemic - before most other banks made the same shift.  To Carter, this is cause to be patient about the momentum behind sustainable payment cards.  ""It might take a little bit for it to take hold, but hopefully in the long run it's going to take hold and we'll be one of the first to have made that leap,"" he said.  Banks aren't just in the business of mailing out plastic cards. They also distributea huge number of pensto their branches. Some go a step further and offer them to customers as promotional materials.  TD Bank, the U.S. unit of Toronto-Dominion, hands out 12 million to 15 million plastic pens a year. It's a branding initiative that began when it was a New Jersey-based company called Commerce Bank, which the Canadian TD purchased in 2008.  Despite rebranding as TD, the bank didn't want to stop handing out pens, but it had two major environmental concerns to contend with: Its pens were made of first-use plastic, and they were all shipped from China (burning a lot of fuel in transit). To address both of these issues, TD embarked on a three-year project to convert to rPET materials and to source its pens locally.  In the end, it chose to work with Pen Company of America in Garwood, New Jersey.  ""Bringing the pen from China back to the U.S., we actually saved money,"" said Lena Forrest, head of branded experiences at TD Bank.",How have banks like Bank of New Hampshire and TD Bank addressed environmental concerns with their plastic card and pen distribution?,"Bank of New Hampshire has addressed environmental concerns with its plastic card distribution by introducing sustainable debit cards, hoping to set an example for other banks.

Share prices surged. Amplats's stock rose from R266 in March 2017 to R2,675 by March last year - a five-year gain of 905%. Implats's trajectory was even more remarkable, rocketing 1,870% from R15.61 to R309 within that same period.  Dunne's Northam Platinum, which didn't pay a cash dividend, saw its share price register a record high in 2021.  Critically, this did far more than just boost the coffers of the miners and their investors; the industry became one of the local economy's rare beacons in 2021.  For one thing, the PGM sector actually created jobs, even as national unemployment hit 29%. Second, PGM and iron ore firms contributed roughly two-thirds of the R78.1bn in South Africa's annual tax take - allowing that number to more than double from the R38.6bn of the year before. In royalties alone, PGM miners paid R5.7bn in 2021, against R1.1bn the prior year.  And then the bubble burst. Having weakened to $12,000 an ounce by December, rhodium was tipped over the edge after glass manufacturer China Jushi returned R8bn in stock - about 50,000oz - to the spot market.

Read the full report by Andrea Blanco below.  Trump boasts about his relationship with Putin saying he was 'the apple of his eye'.                      Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Swedish prime minister pictured together                   . Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in Sweden on his first foreign trip since attending a NATO summit in Lithuania last month.  At a joint news conference, Zelenskyy and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson announced the two countries had agreed to cooperate on the production, training and servicing of Swedish CV90 infantry fighting vehicles. Zelenskyy said Ukraine would start manufacturing the vehicles as part of the deal.He also encouraged Kristersson to ""share"" Sweden's Gripen fighter aircraft with Ukraine.""We do not have superiority in the air, and we do not have modern aircraft. In reality, the Swedish Gripen is the pride of your country, and I believe that the prime minister could share this pride with Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said.Sweden has said it will allow Ukrainian pilots to test the Gripen planes but has so far ruled out giving any to Kyiv.                       Chernihiv rocket attack is a 'terrorism' and 'war crime'                   .

4,"not making substantive steps to improve ties with China despite détente atmosphere."". Few in China had anticipated the ""aggressiveness"" of the Biden administration, says Mark Leonard, director of the European Institute of International Relations, in a recent article in Foreign Affairs. Some Chinese analysts today compare Biden's actions to those of former president Donald Trump against Iran, according to Leonard. ""A consensus has formed in Beijing that Washington's goal is not to make China play by the rules; it is to stop China from growing."" The analysis concludes that this belief is wrong: the goal of Washington and the European Union is to ensure that their businesses do not share sensitive technologies with Beijing and to reduce dependence on imports in strategic sectors. This is what Brussels has called derisking.  Shortly after Blinken's visit, a Chinese businessman and Communist Party member, concerned that business in China has not bounced back enough after the pandemic, called for less ""derisking"" and more ""depoliticizing."" Speaking to EL PAÍS on the condition of anonymity, he made this observation while drinking French wine from a hotel overlooking Tiananmen Square in Beijing. A government official in one of China's biggest cities also told EL PAÍS: ""We need communication."". Depoliticization. Chinese Premier Li Qiang spoke along the same lines last Tuesday during a meeting with Raimondo: ""Politicizing and overstretching the concept of security on economic and trade issues not only seriously affects bilateral relations and mutual trust, but also harms the interests of enterprises and people in both countries,"" he said, according to the Chinese news agency Xinhua. But Beijing, he said, was willing to ""strengthen dialogue and cooperation"" on trade and the economy.  After a bad summer for China — which saw negative prices, low consumption, a drop in exports and higher youth unemployment — the Chinese government has begun to take shock measures to try to reactivate the economy. One measure is the call for increased foreign investment. Beijing is urgently seeking to ease multinational companies' apprehension about investing in China. But the mood is far from propitious.",What is the goal of the Biden administration and the European Union in relation to China?,"The goal of the Biden administration and the European Union in relation to China is to ensure that their businesses do not share sensitive technologies with Beijing and to reduce dependence on imports in strategic sectors.

US President Joe Biden will travel to New Delhi from September 7 to September 10 to attend the G20 summit and participate in bilateral meetings with a range of leaders, American national security advisor Jake Sullivan announced on Tuesday.  Biden will strongly push for the reform of multilateral development banks (MDBs) with a proposal that enhances the financial capability of these institutions to address challenges of poverty elimination, boosting prosperity and addressing the climate crisis. Sullivan added that Biden will also send a message to the global south that the US stands with them.  In a press briefing on Tuesday morning, Sullivan, in the context of the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) summit in South Africa this week, said that the US doesn't see Brics as a ""geopolitical rival"", claimed that the group has a diverse collection of countries, and Washington has a ""positive"" relationship with Brazil, India and South Africa even as it ""manages"" its relationship with China and ""pushes back"" against Russia.

Weapons for wheat?. Russia needs to secure additional artillery rounds, even if the shells that North Korea has in stock are based on designs from half-a-century ago.  Although these less-advanced weapons do not allow for precision attacks, they could be used for barrages on civilian infrastructure and Ukrainian positions.  North Korea has retained the weapons production facilities provided to it by the former Soviet Union during the 1950-53 Korean War and has been building up its stockpiles ever since.  The country, however, is experiencing dramatic food shortages after another poor harvest season and has been short of fuel since initial sanctions from 2006 were stepped up in 2017. It's likely that Kim will request food and fuel supplies to ease those shortages.  North Korea is also attempting to build more high-tech satellite technology, and Russian material could provide a boost.  Two attempts to launch rockets carrying satellites have failed in recent months and Kim may very well ask Putin to share rocket technology, which is in many cases identical to the technology required to launch long-range missiles.  Nuclear weapons technology may also be on the North Koreans' shopping list, including the know-how required for the safe atmospheric reentry of a nuclear warhead atop an intercontinental ballistic missile, a challenge that analysts believe Kim's scientists have not yet overcome.  And while Kim may ask for the most advanced technology that Moscow can provide, such as technology to miniaturize nuclear devices or propel nuclear-powered submarines, Putin is unlikely to give away all his secrets, said Leif-Eric Easley, an associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.  ""Even a desperate war machine does not trade its military crown jewels for old, dumb munitions,"" Easley told DW.  Kim also attended the launch earlier this week of what the North claimed was its first ICBM-capable submarine, based on a heavily modified Russian design that dates back to the 1950s.",What does North Korea hope to obtain from Russia in a potential weapons deal?,"In a potential weapons deal, North Korea hopes to obtain additional artillery rounds, as well as food and fuel supplies to alleviate their shortages.

Sources told the Monitor that anywhere from 10% to 25% of their clients move in part to get away from fires and because of Vermont's ""more predictable weather patterns."". Elizabeth Fussell, a demographer and sociologist at Brown University, believes these movers are part of an emerging trend – one that reflects a changing rationale among Americans. . ""When people in the U.S. see a destructive event like a wildfire, hurricane, tornado, or a flood, they typically use the tools that we have at hand – FEMA money and insurance – to rebuild and restore themselves to their pre-disaster condition,"" she says.

Elon Musk says he refused to give Kyiv access to his Starlink communications network over Crimea to avoid complicity in a ""major act of war"".  Kyiv had sent an emergency request to activate Starlink to Sevastopol, home to a major Russian navy port, he said.  His comments came after a book alleged he had switched off Starlink to thwart a drone attack on Russian ships.  A senior Ukrainian official says this enabled Russian attacks and accused him of ""committing evil"".  Russian naval vessels had since taken part in deadly attacks on civilians, he said.  ""By not allowing Ukrainian drones to destroy part of the Russian military (!) fleet via Starlink interference, Elon Musk allowed this fleet to fire Kalibr missiles at Ukrainian cities,"" he said.  ""Why do some people so desperately want to defend war criminals and their desire to commit murder? And do they now realize that they are committing evil and encouraging evil?"" he added.  The row follows the release of a biography of the billionaire by Walter Isaacson which alleges that Mr Musk switched off Ukraine's access to Starlink because he feared that an ambush of Russia's naval fleet in Crimea could provoke a nuclear response from the Kremlin.  Ukraine targeted Russian ships in Sevastopol with submarine drones carrying explosives but they lost connection to Starlink and ""washed ashore harmlessly"", Mr Isaacson wrote.  Starlink terminals connect to SpaceX satellites in orbit and have been crucial for maintaining internet connectivity and communication in Ukraine as the conflict has disrupted the country infrastructure.  SpaceX, in which Mr Musk is the largest shareholder, began providing thousands of Starlink satellite dishes to Ukraine shortly after Russia launched its full-scale assault on its neighbour in February last year.  Responding to the book's claim, Mr Musk said on X that SpaceX ""did not deactivate anything"" because it had not been activated in those regions in the first place.  ""There was an emergency request from government authorities to activate Starlink all the way to Sevastopol.

Host nation South Africa also sees potential in the group to rebalance the world order away from the west, in favour of the Global South.  Who else wants in?. The five original BRICS members account for 40 per cent of the global population and more than one third of the world's economic output. But more than 40 nations across the global south are now interested in joining, some of which sent delegations to the sidelines of the summit.  On Thursday, the sought-after invitation landed for six nations. Significantly, the world's top oil exporter Saudi Arabia is among them, a move which connects some of the world's largest energy producers with the biggest consumers.  India's former ambassador to Saudi Arabia aid Talmiz Ahmad this week told the Associated Press it would bring ""extraordinary importance to this grouping,"" if Saudi Arabia were to join.

Chris Christie, who has mocked Trump's claim of being ""indicted for you,"" noted this week that Russian President Vladimir Putin -- a dictator who is considered an enemy of the U.S. -- echoed his claim that a rotten system is targeting an ex-president.  ""Trump is under indictment because of his conduct,"" Christie said on the social media website X. ""He played with fire and is getting burned."". The former president is expected to spotlight his message Friday with two speeches in Washington, D.C. One is to the Concerned Women for America organization and the other is at a ""Pray Vote Stand Summit."". 'It's a sham'. Trump faces two legal cases involving efforts to overturn the 2020 election, another one involving obstruction of justice and hiding classified documents, and another one involving hush money payments - yet many of his backers are sticking with him out of distrust of the accusers.  Jacob A. Fokken, 28, an automotive repairman from Las Vegas, Nevada, said the government only wants to ""help the people they want,"" and go after opponents like Trump.  ""You can say what you want against anybody without any proof,"" he said.  As for the system itself, he said: ""It's a sham."". Many Republicans seem to agree. The Real Clear Politics website average of national polls gives Trump more than 56% of the Republican vote. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is far behind in second place at 13%.  Local polls also give Trump huge leads in early contest states like Iowa and New Hampshire.  Can you believe what you're told?. Trump's long-term campaign against institutions feature another prominent target: the news media. His supporters agree with that message.

0,"However, Argentina retains the highest GDP among the six newly invited nations but its half decade long crisis creates some speculation over overall impact on BRICS economies after the inclusion of a failing economy. Within the current BRICS member states, Brazil notably takes the lead as Argentina's primary trade partner, boasting a trade volume amounting to 32.95 billion USD in the year 2022. China follows with a figure of 16 billion USD, trailed by India at 6.4 billion USD. Importantly, it's worth noting that three out of Argentina's top four trading associates are aligned with the BRICS coalition, making Argentina's inclusion in the group an exceptionally fitting proposition.  In the meantime, Argentina is gearing up for elections in October 2023, and the leader of the opposition has issued a warning that they would withdraw from BRICS if they win. The two primary opposition candidates for the upcoming October elections, libertarian leader Javier Milei and right-wing candidate Patricia Bullrich, have both announced their intentions, stating that they would prevent the country from becoming a member of the group of emerging economies. Milei, who has previously stated his reluctance to engage in trade with ""communist"" nations, a categorization he applies to Brazil and China, has expressed his aversion to dealing with countries under left-leaning governance in general. Milei received the maximum vote among all presidential candidates in the primary presidential election.  Nonetheless, it's clear that Argentina's association with the IMF has been an ongoing saga. Since 1956, Argentina has engaged in 21 IMF arrangements with the IMF and has faced multiple instances of default in its history. Involvement in IMF programs hasn't yielded a reliable solution for Argentina's economic stability, which has motivated Argentine leaders to explore BRICS membership. Conversely, opposition leaders are sceptical about the potential benefits of BRICS in addressing Argentina's escalating inflation and turtle growth. As a result, they are issuing threats to discontinue BRICS involvement and maintain the status quo with the IMF and the U.S. dollar, if they return to power.",Why are the two primary opposition candidates in Argentina's upcoming elections opposed to the country's membership in BRICS?,"The two primary opposition candidates, Javier Milei and Patricia Bullrich, are opposed to Argentina's membership in BRICS because they have expressed a reluctance to engage in trade with ""communist"" nations, which they categorize Brazil and China as.

0,"But as the world's second-largest economy, a prolonged slowdown in China will hurt, rather than help, the rest of the world. An analysis from the International Monetary Fund shows how much is at stake: when China's growth rate rises by 1 percentage point, global expansion is boosted by about 0.3 percentage points.China's deflation ""isn't such a bad thing"" for the global economy, Peter Berezin, chief global strategist BCA Research Inc., said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. ""But, if the rest of the world, the US and Europe, falls into recession, if China remains weak, then that would be a problem — not just for China but for the whole global economy."". Here's a look at how China's slowdown is rippling across economies and financial markets.  Trade Slump Many countries, especially those in Asia, count China as their biggest export market for everything from electronic parts and food to metals and energy.  The value of Chinese imports has fallen for nine of the last 10 months as demand retreats from the record highs set during the pandemic. The value of shipments from Africa, Asia and North America were all lower in July than they were a year ago.  Africa and Asia have been the hardest hit, with the value of imports down more than 14% in the first seven months this year. Part of that is due to a drop in demand for electronics parts from South Korea and Taiwan, while falling prices of commodities such as fossil fuels are also hitting the value of goods shipped to China.  So far, the actual volume of commodities such as iron or copper ore sent to China has held up. But if the slowdown continues, shipments could be impacted, which would affect miners in Australia, South America and elsewhere around the world.  Deflation Pressure Producer prices in China have contracted for the past 10 months, meaning the cost of goods being shipped from the country is falling. That's welcome news for people around the globe still struggling with high inflation.  The price of Chinese goods at US docks has fallen every month this year and that is likely to continue until factory prices in China return to positive territory. Economists at Wells Fargo & Co.",How is China's slowdown impacting global economies and financial markets?,"China's slowdown is impacting global economies and financial markets in several ways. Firstly, many countries, especially in Asia, heavily rely on China as their biggest export market. The decline in China's demand for imports has led to a slump in trade for these countries, with the value of shipments from Africa, Asia, and North America being lower compared to the previous year. This has particularly affected Africa and Asia, with imports down more than 14% in the first seven months of this year. Additionally, falling prices of commodities and a contraction in China's producer prices have put deflationary pressure on the global economy. However, as stated in the excerpt, a prolonged slowdown in China would not be beneficial for the rest of the world, as it could lead to a recession in other major economies like the US and Europe, impacting the global economy as a whole.",c75d66bd4c9f74ed37bd96b1fb6d3b2d

8,"Digital pathology is costly. Paige is the only company that has received FDA approval for pathologists to use its AI as a secondary tool for identifying prostate cancer, and CEO Andy Moye said this is likely in part because of barriers related to storage costs and data collection.  Digitizing a single slide can require over a gigabyte of storage, so the infrastructure and costs associated with large-scale data collection balloon quickly. Fuchs said the storage costs can be inhibiting for smaller health systems, which is why wealthy academic centers have historically been the only organizations that can afford to invest in digital pathology.  Paige spun out of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York in 2017 and has a ""fantastic wealth of data,"" according to Moye, which is why the company was able to build its own AI-powered solutions in the first place. To put the scale in perspective, Paige has 10 times more data than Netflix, including all the shows and movies that exist on the platform.  But in order to expand its operations and build an AI tool that can identify more cancer types, Paige turned to Microsoft for help. Over the past year and a half, Paige has been using Microsoft's cloud storage and supercomputing infrastructure to build an advanced new AI model.  Paige's original AI model used more than 1 billion images from 500,000 pathology slides, but Fuchs said the model the company has built with Microsoft is ""orders of magnitude larger than anything out there."" The model is training on 4 million slides to identify both common and rare cancers, which can be difficult to diagnose. Paige said it is the largest computer vision model that has ever been announced publicly.  ""Until ChatGPT got released, no one really understood how this is going to impact their lives. I would argue this is very similar for cancer patients going forward,"" Moye said. ""This is sort of a groundbreaking, land-on-the-moon kind of moment for cancer care."". Moye added that the company is thinking of ways to incorporate predictive modeling to give pathologists and patients easy access to information about their biomarkers and genomic mutations down the line.",What is the significance and impact of Paige's partnership with Microsoft in developing an advanced AI model for identifying various types of cancer?,"The partnership between Paige and Microsoft is significant because it allows Paige to leverage Microsoft's cloud storage and supercomputing infrastructure to build an advanced AI model for identifying various types of cancer.

The collaboration with Microsoft enables Paige to expand its operations and develop a groundbreaking tool that can have a transformative impact on cancer care.

WASHINGTON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday is expected to set a start date for former U.S. President Donald Trump's criminal trial on charges of trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat in a failed bid to keep himself in power.  The criminal case brought in Washington, D.C., by Special Counsel Jack Smith is one of four that Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, currently faces and the one that most broadly addresses his attempt to reverse his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.  Trump, who on Thursday appeared at a Georgia jail to face state criminal charges of trying to overturn his defeat there, is not expected to attend Monday's hearing.  Trump has previously lashed out at U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, saying, without evidence, that she is biased against him. He has portrayed all four criminal prosecutions as politically motivated attempts to stop him from returning to power.  Smith's office has proposed starting the trial on Jan. 2, 2024, some 11 months before Election Day, and predicted it would take four to six weeks. Trump's lawyers have asked Chutkan to delay the trial until April 2026.  ""The public interest lies in justice and fair trial, not a rush to judgment,"" Trump's lawyers wrote in their motion.  Trump's attorneys have complained that the government's 11.5 million pages of evidence will take time to sort through, saying that if the pages were stacked, they would tower well above the Washington Monument and would equate to reading Leo Tolstoy's 'War and Peace' ""78 times a day, every day, from now until jury selection."". ""To put 11.5 million pages in some perspective, we began downloading the government's initial production on August 13, 2023. Two days later, it was still downloading,"" they wrote.

Buenos Aires — Moody's Investors Services has hiked up its growth projections for Latin America in 2023, mainly due to Mexico's strong performance in the first half, according to a report from the rating agency. In its June report on the region, the US firm had predicted a 1.2% real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for Latin America this year, whereas now it is expecting 1.5%.  But not all is rosy for the region. Moody's also anticipates a significant economic contraction in Argentina, as well as a setback in Chile's GDP.  Mexico Leading the Way. Moody's projects that the Mexican GDP will expand by 3.3% in 2023, following a 3.9% growth in 2022. The financial firm attributes these optimistic expectations for the region's second-largest economy to its strong performance in the first half of the year.  This growth is attributable to increased investments, especially in non-residential construction, Moody's noted, adding that some of these investments are linked to nearshoring activities and public-sector initiatives, where the government has accelerated the execution of key projects.  PUBLICIDAD. However, the document also cautions that high local interest rates, declining business confidence, and weak demand from the United States will exert pressure on domestic demand for the remainder of the year.  Moody's has also adjusted its projections for Chile. Initially, it predicted a 1% decline in the country's economy, but it now foresees a more moderate contraction of 0.5%. Meanwhile, the consultancy firm estimates that Peru will achieve a 1.3% growth rate.  Gentileza de Moody's Investors Service. Brazil GDP Growth in 2023.

An everyday family dinner in the Belgian city of Antwerp came to a sudden halt earlier this year when gunfire boomed outside. Four family members around the table were shot, including an 11-year-old girl who died from her injuries.  The deadly shooting in the quiet suburb lined with squat brick buildings shed light on the dark side of the port city s most lucrative trade: cocaine trafficking.  The victim was the niece of two of Belgium s most notorious fugitives, wanted internationally for drug trafficking and money laundering: Othman and Younes El Ballouti. The younger, Younes, manages his older brother s cocaine business. In the same week as the shooting, he was sentenced in absentia to eight years in prison.

8,"Perhaps most impressively, Apple is requiring its suppliers to use only renewable energy for Apple-related work—and investing alongside those suppliers in new clean energy sources. (Without new sources, clean energy pledges risk pushing other electricity users to dirtier fuels.) It also says it has calculated the lifetime electricity usage from an Apple Watch owner charging the device and will invest in its own power projects to compensate.  Let's be clear: Most companies don't make such laudable efforts to clean up their supply chains. Many are currently battling with US regulators over whether they should even be expected to tally up those emissions at all. They cry foul, citing their deep and complicated supply chains. Go back far enough—to, say, the distant processors of the ores that become the minerals that become their computer chips or face creams or coffee cups—and companies claim not to even know who to call upon to clean up their act. Oh, and it's too expensive. Hardly worth the trouble.  Apple's supply chain efforts, though heroic by comparison, illustrate the limits of how far corporate greening can get you toward carbon neutral—only about three-quarters of the way by the company's estimation. Boats still burn fuel, after all. Recycled materials can't cover everything. More stuff is still more stuff. So the rest comes from carbon credits, generated from investments in nature conservation and restoration projects intended to sock away CO2 so it can't warm the globe.  Organizations such as the Advertising Standards Authority, the UK's advertising regulator, have warned companies to take particular care when backing ""carbon neutral"" claims with carbon credits. The organization's research found that consumers indeed take the phrase literally—""an absolute reduction in carbon emissions""—and then feel misled when it turns out to involve producing new emissions and then claiming some don't count due to crediting, says Toby King, an ASA spokesperson. Such cases require ""case-by-case"" scrutiny, he adds.  The packaging for the new Apple Watch and band lineup is 100 percent fiber-based.  Courtesy of Apple. Part of the problem is the slipperiness of attempting to tie a carbon credit—an abstract financial instrument—to any particular product in Apple's armada of product offerings or the wider global economy.",What are some of the challenges and limitations faced by companies in their efforts to achieve carbon neutrality?,"Some of the challenges and limitations faced by companies in their efforts to achieve carbon neutrality include the complexity of their supply chains and difficulties in tracing emissions back to their original sources. Many companies claim that they don't even know who to contact to address the emissions produced in the production of their products. Additionally, while companies like Apple make significant efforts to clean up their supply chains and invest in renewable energy sources, there are still limitations to how far corporate greening can go. For example, boats still burn fuel and recycled materials cannot cover everything. As a result, companies often rely on carbon credits generated from investments in nature conservation and restoration projects to offset their remaining emissions. However, there is scrutiny over the use of carbon credits and claims of being ""carbon neutral,"" as consumers may feel misled if these claims involve producing new emissions and then using credits to offset them.",21d70dfb291df5bf11119110d3a1e72a

Milwaukee, US, Aug 24 (EFE).- After almost an hour of deliberating over policy matters, the Republican presidential hopefuls shifted their focus toward the front-runner, Donald Trump, who was notably absent at the first debate of the 2024 campaign.  Trump made his presence felt, albeit in absentia, at the first Republican primary debate.  The debate turned chaotic when moderators said they would spend just a ""brief moment"" bringing out ""the elephant not in the room."". The eight White House contenders spent some 15 minutes of the two-hour debate discussing the Republican frontrunner, who faces a series of cases on handling classified documents, trying to overturn the 2020 election, and paying hush money to a porn star.  Fox News organized the event in the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  And when it came to making their choices known if they would rally behind if a convicted Trump won the Republican nomination.  In a reminder of the power he wields in the party, most candidates raised their hands to support Trump, but Chris Christie did not.

8,"""Young people,"" he told an audience at Stanford University, ""are just smarter."". They aren't, actually. The tech industry's hostility to ageing ""continues to violate common sense,"" Joseph Coughlin, the director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's AgeLab, told me.  His lab conducts research on how an ageing population is changing business. He said that companies in the auto industry, financial services, retail and other sectors are coming around to the emerging opportunities of the ""longevity economy,"" the 1.6 billion people around the world who will be 65 or older by the year 2050.  Silicon Valley remains a glaring exception. The tech giants are among the world's largest and most innovative businesses; if they took a more open-minded approach to ageing — if they considered solving the problems of older customers as eagerly as they chased teen fads — they could establish a model for ageing in a tech-besotted world.  Through advances focused on health care, home assistance, transportation, robotics and artificial intelligence, technology will be crucial to address the problems emerging from demographic imbalance. If there are not enough younger people to care for and cater to the needs of the old, we will increasingly lean on tech to add convenience, independence and perhaps even companionship to our lengthening sunset years.  Stuck in the past. Yet this trillion-dollar industry that imagines itself inventing the future is stuck in the past, its views of older customers, older employees and how to best serve them hopelessly misaligned with facts, business logic and demographic destiny.  ""The market is ageing. The market is numerous. The market has got more money than the people they have been building products for,"" Coughlin said. ""And yet they continue to ignore them."". What can Silicon Valley do for older people? One place to look is in health care, where — lured by the vast riches of Medicare Advantage, a program that offers seniors a way to buy private medical insurance paid for in part by Medicare — venture capitalists and entrepreneurs have begun to recognise the market opportunity in ageing.",How is Silicon Valley's approach to aging customers and employees misaligned with business logic and demographic trends?,"Silicon Valley's approach to aging customers and employees is misaligned with business logic and demographic trends because the tech industry remains hostile to aging and continues to ignore the opportunities presented by the ""longevity economy."" This economy refers to the 1.6 billion people worldwide who will be 65 or older by 2050. Despite the fact that this market is both numerous and financially affluent, Silicon Valley's views and actions towards older customers and employees are not in line with the market's potential. This misalignment prevents the tech industry from effectively addressing the problems emerging from an aging population and tapping into the opportunities for innovation and profit in the field of aging. The excerpt suggests that if Silicon Valley were to adopt a more open-minded approach to aging, it could establish a model for addressing the needs of older individuals and lead the way in leveraging technology to enhance the convenience, independence, and companionship of the elderly.",6557bd5d87330a0f8cb615dd68ddcb73
8,"LOUIS LI, MELBOURNE. Louis Li, owner of the Jackalope Hotel on the Mornington Peninsula, is best known for bringing the phenomenally popular experiential artwork Rain Room, by artists Hannes Koch and Florian Ortkrass, to Australia.  It's fair to say his art collection, known as the Jackalope Art Collection, is a little different to many.  ""I consider it a private collection,"" says Li, ""we're not an institution. It's similar to the White Rabbit model. I like to find opportunities to showcase my works in my properties or institutional contexts."". Many of the works are on display at the Jackalope Hotel – most notably the specially commissioned seven-metre monumental sculpture of the hotel's namesake – but one of Li's favourite works, a recent acquisition, is Del Kathryn Barton's The Women Who Fell To Earth, which hangs in his office.  ""She's one of my favourite Australian artists,"" Li says. ""I think the highly detailed painting skills and the time consumption is just amazing. I've always wanted a Del Kathryn Barton in my collection, and this is perfect – it's so euphoric and emotional."". Li, who moved to Australia from China in 2007 to study filmmaking, has always loved art, and is drawn to works that explore mysticism.  ""My curatorial framework is occultism and metaphysics. That's why I named my hotel Jackalope, which is from mythology,"" he says. ""I always liked things with mysticism, or a little bit of darkness."". Another recent addition to his collection is a video work from New Zealand-born artist Daniel Crooks, a two-channel work called Phantom Ride.  ""I think this is one of his significant video works, and he's been collected by ACMI."". The work explores the linear nature of time and is, says Li, ""mesmerising"".  ""It explores how we travel through time and space through the old network between New South Wales and Victoria. It's two screens so you see the precise point of the future and the past and present in front of you – it's a really beautiful work."".",What is the curatorial framework of Louis Li's art collection at the Jackalope Hotel?,"The curatorial framework of Louis Li's art collection at the Jackalope Hotel is centered around occultism and metaphysics.

In restaurants, diners chat about life, friends and jobs and discuss whether they liked the Barbie or Oppenheimer movie better, or which concert they might attend.

8,"Ukraine and Russia in legal battle over war motive. Russia has called on the International Court of Justice to throw out a case brought against it by Ukraine.  Kyiv accuses Moscow of falsely using genocide law to justify its invasion.  Russia maintains that it intervened in Ukraine to prevent a genocidal attack on ethnic Russians in the east.  The court hearing in The Hague will not examine the legality of Russia's invasion, but will instead consider whether the International Court is allowed to examine Ukraine's claims.  Ukraine says there was no risk of genocide in the east of the country, where it had been fighting Russian-backed forces since 2014.  It adds that the genocide treaty does not in any case permit an invasion to stop an alleged genocide.  For its part, Russia describes Ukraine's case as ""hopelessly flawed"" and says that what Kyiv really wants is a ruling on the rights and wrongs of Russia's military action.  Ukraine brought the case days after the Russian invasion on 24 February last year.  In mid-March, the ICJ - the United Nations' highest court - called on Russia to suspend its military operations in Ukraine, but Russia did not accept this order, objecting to the court's jurisdiction and describing Ukraine's application as inadmissible.  In court on Monday, Russia's legal representative, Gennady Kuzmin, said that since Ukraine insisted no genocide had occurred, there could not have been a violation of the United Nations Genocide Convention.  ""That alone should be enough to reject the case,"" he added.  In the coming days, the court will hear submissions from 32 other nations, all supporting Ukraine's argument that the court has the proper jurisdiction to handle the case.  The hearings are expected to last until 27 September.  The 1948 UN Genocide Convention defined genocide as crimes committed ""with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such."". Russian officials continue to accuse Ukraine of committing genocide.

All of this must be done while increasing the volume and health benefits of the food already grown. Consumers are increasingly demanding cheap food produced with lower emissions, higher animal welfare standards and greater transparency.  Australian food producers have been going like ""stabbed rats"" for the past three years to take advantage of higher commodity prices and three consecutive La Niñas to grow more food. It was all very welcome, unless you were flooded out.  Elsewhere, big trends continue to collide. There was a searing heatwave in Europe. Food inflation has been running rampant, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, higher input costs, higher labour costs, supply chain issues and in some cases increased supermarket profits.  Nations are rethinking their food systems and keeping more in the larder. India, responsible for 40% of world's rice exports, recently banned exports of non-basmati white rice. It is just one example of a post-Covid world where countries and individuals want to become a little more self-sufficient. Equally, no nation wants to be living in energy poverty and Australia has the capacity to be a renewable superpower.  Yet last week the Bureau of Meteorology forecast warmer and drier conditions for the coming months, saying ""higher than usual maximum temperatures are very likely"".  Previously optimistic farmers in our neck of the woods are countenancing a ""bobtail spring"", cut short by higher temperatures and less rain.  Firm policy guidelines are needed about how these climate and market forces hit the ground. A decade of denial from the Morrison government has led to a stampede to catch up to provide energy and carbon sequestration.  There is a new gold rush, and it needs land.",What are some of the factors driving the need for increased food production with lower emissions and greater transparency?,"Some of the factors driving the need for increased food production with lower emissions and greater transparency include increasing demand from consumers for cheap food produced with lower emissions and higher animal welfare standards.

What more are we learning?. STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SR. EDITOR, AFIRCA: That's right Paula. Several countries have said that they will send humanitarian aid to Libya and they include Egypt, the UAE, Turkey, Italy and Algeria. But the politically fragmented situation in the country is complicating this rescue mission somewhat and countries now have to decide whether they will send aid to the capital or to the rival administration in Benghazi.  Libya, you will remember, has had no unified government. and two rival administrations have been locked in a political standoff since 2014.

8,"Breton's approach in Brussels, a town notorious for bureaucracy and caution, has been controversial. The commissioner has been accused by non-EU business interests and liberal critics of being a mouthpiece for France, both its companies and government. Tech companies argue that his efforts to force large streaming sites like YouTube and Netflix to help pay for internet infrastructure are nothing more than a gift to telecoms providers such as Orange, which Breton used to run. They also point out that a cybersecurity certification proposal he's backed would mainly benefit French cloud companies. An aide to Breton called these accusations false and prejudiced, as the telecom legislation hasn't yet been proposed, and the cyber plan would help all European companies be competitive.  The commissioner's frequent meetings with CEOs have also drawn criticism. Some argue that Breton is too close to the CEOs he regulates. (Pat Gelsinger, the new CEO of Intel and the biggest beneficiary of Breton's Chips Act, is a longtime friend.) Others say that these relationships are more for his own benefit than that of the regulation. Before Musk purchased Twitter, Breton flew to Texas and got the world's richest man to film an awkward video saying he agreed with the EU's ideas about content moderation. In contrast with Musk's contentious relationship with US regulators, Musk and Breton have developed a rapport over the past year, in part through their shared affection for semiconductors and satellites.  ""I find it problematic that he considered the balance of power with Musk was going to be established with a handshake and a gentleman's agreement following a discussion behind closed doors,"" Jean Cattan, secretary general at the French National Digital Council, a policy research group that advises the French government.

8,"But these actions alone can't completely decarbonize the industry. ""That's not really surprising,"" explains Michael Clark, director of the Smith School's sustainable food solutions program at the University of Oxford and co-author of the study. ""If you're producing something, that's going to have emissions. The only way of having a fully net-zero food system is to not have a food system at all."" Hence, the importance of novel technologies.  Share this articleShare. Researchers explored many scenarios, from what would happen with 100% tech adoption and no other changes to the consequences of purely non-tech interventions. The results are hopeful: If 50% of humanity adopted a flexitarian diet, food loss was halved and the novel tech had a 50% adoption rate, then the food industry would remove 6.7 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) a year. If everyone adopted a flexitarian diet, then that would nearly double to 12.4 billion metric tons of sequestered CO2e. That's huge. In 2019, global aviation was approximately 920 million metric tons of CO2.  It's important to note that this isn't a sure thing. There are still large knowledge gaps to close and big challenges to overcome. Some of the technologies have only been tested in small-scale trials, leaving questions over their performance at the huge scales required. The study also didn't factor in the economics and practicalities of adopting novel tech, which are likely to be high barriers. Any potential effects on water and biodiversity should also be researched.  We've already seen governments struggle to manage agricultural decarbonization. In the Netherlands, a new political party sprung up after farmers were outraged by government plans to pay them to close their farms in order to reduce nitrogen pollution. In Ireland, farmers have been pressured to cull cows. No doubt, herds will have to diminish — but fixing the problem must consider heritage and cultural concerns and offer farmers more than a payout.  Persuading people to shift their dining habits is also hitting a similar wall.",What is the potential impact of adopting a flexitarian diet and novel technologies on carbon emissions in the food industry?,"The potential impact of adopting a flexitarian diet and novel technologies in the food industry is the removal of a significant amount of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions.

8,"The techniques of infiltration and subversion of accepted truth are not new. In my Marxist youth I was very familiar with the process of joining established organisations – political parties, trade unions, local associations – and making use of that affiliation to persuade (subtly) and indoctrinate (unsubtly) its members in the belief system that tried to expose the real evil that was their enemy. . Indeed, the hardcore Left excelled at explaining any source of discontent as being based in exploitation by the forces of capitalism. Whatever your problem – alienation from your family, incompatibility with your peers, dissatisfaction with your job – it could be understood as a form of social injustice embedded in an evil system. And the organising ideologues who promoted this interpretation were relentless talent scouts, expert at spotting precisely those susceptible individuals whose (various but often legitimate) sources of discontent could be reinterpreted in the terms of class war. . Every industrial conflict, every student protest, every neighbourhood action group was an opportunity for recruitment to that much larger theory which had a ready explanation for all unfairness and discontent. Make no mistake, Marxism – with its captivating account of the seductions of bourgeois culture – can seem like a breathtaking revelation, especially to those who, for any reason, feel disenchanted with their society. . In its later Herbert Marcuse form, the New Left offered a brand of Marxism that went beyond pure economics and offered what was effectively an account of the whole of the human psycho-social dynamic. It swept through the 1960s and 1970s like an intellectual tidal wave. The conversions and later recantations of those who were recruited and then became disillusioned was a notable phenomenon over subsequent decades. . But there was a serious difficulty with this overt recruitment to revolutionary socialism. During the Cold War, if you signed up openly for the cause, you were officially working for the Other Side. You were not just proposing an alternative view of how government should operate, but declaring yourself to be working for the enemy. Your actions and your affiliations were part of a contest for world domination that threatened the extinction of democracy and personal freedom – and possibly of the entire human population.","What was the author's experience with infiltration and indoctrination in their Marxist youth, and why did openly signing up for the cause pose a serious difficulty during the Cold War?","In the author's Marxist youth, they were familiar with the process of joining established organizations, such as political parties and trade unions, and using these affiliations to subtly persuade and overtly indoctrinate members with the Marxist belief system.

With the advent of technologies like 400G high-speed networking and Artificial Intelligence (AI), industries such as healthcare and diagnostics have experienced a huge transformation in recent years. But as always, no matter the industry, technological breakthroughs require a whole new set of skills.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, high-speed networking emerged as a lifeline, enabling seamless communication and facilitating pivotal advancements in healthcare. Remote patient monitoring became more efficient and widespread, ensuring the vulnerable could be cared for without risking exposure. Concurrently, rapid clinical data processing was pivotal in accelerating research and development. This digital agility played a crucial role in understanding the virus's behavior and was instrumental in the expeditious development of a vaccine, heralding a new era in medical research and response.  Rugved Bidkar is a seasoned professional in this arena. Currently serving as a product manager at Juniper Networks, he's making substantial strides toward integrating these powerful technologies for early detection of diseases.  ""I've spent more than eight years in product management of high-speed computer networking products like enterprise and datacenter switches,"" Bidkar shares. ""I was privileged to be part of creating the first merchant silicon-based 400G capable high-speed data center networking product in the industry."". Based on this accomplishment, Bidkar set out to utilize this and similar products toward the bolstering of AI applications - especially in the critical area of healthcare.  ""AI is very quickly establishing itself as a formidable tool for analyzing vast amounts of data quickly and accurately,"" Bidkar explains. ""While many people might not immediately grasp the connection between healthcare and AI, it's clear to those in my field that AI can become a major player - and even save lives."". He points to the fact that AI applications can sift through thousands of patient records, lab results, and clinical trial data to identify patterns or anomalies that could suggest a potential disease or health risk. The significant constraint has been the infrastructure required to facilitate such intensive data processing, and this is where Bidkar's expertise in 400G high-speed networking comes into play.  400G high-speed networking, also known as 400 Gigabit Ethernet, is the latest milestone in networking technology.",What role did high-speed networking play in the advancements made in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic according to the excerpt?,"According to the excerpt, high-speed networking played a crucial role during the COVID-19 pandemic by enabling seamless communication and facilitating advancements in healthcare.

In writing about Trump's speech from the Ellipse on January 6, 2021, to his supporters who then overran the Capitol, Baude and Paulsen said Trump delivered a ""general and specific message"" that the election was stolen, calling on the crowd to take immediate action to block the transfer of power before falling silent for hours as the insurrection progressed.  ""Trump's deliberate inaction renders his January 6 speech much more incriminating in hindsight, because it makes it even less plausible (if it was ever plausible) that the crowd's reaction was all a big mistake or misunderstanding,"" they write.  The law professors argued current and former officeholders who took part in supporting or planning the efforts to overturn the election for Trump should also be ""stringently scrutinized"" under the Constitution should they seek bids for future public office.  Baude and Paulsen also noted that Trump's ""overall course of conduct disqualifies him"" from eligibility as a candidate, regardless of whether he is convicted of criminal charges related to the 2020 election – which he now faces in Georgia state court and in federal court – or whether he is held liable in a major civil conspiracy lawsuit related to the attack.  ""If the public record is accurate, the case is not even close. He is no longer eligible to the office of Presidency,"" the law review article said.  The pair also looked at the historical intentions of this section of the 14th Amendment, which barred Confederates after the Civil War from holding office again, because if they were to be allowed, the US would never be able to engage in ""effective 'reconstruction' of the political order"" and newly freed formerly enslaved people wouldn't be properly protected.  ""Not since the Civil War has there been so serious a threat to the foundations of the American constitutional republic,"" Baude and Paulsen wrote about the Capitol attack and Trump's illegitimate attempt to hold onto power.  They note that more people died and were injured as a result of the January 6, 2021, attack than in the 1861 Battle of Fort Sumter that began the Civil War.

The former leader of the far-right Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, was not in Washington on that day, but he was sentenced 22 years in prison for what the judge described as his outside role in the attack.  Prosecutors had sought 33 years in prison. The judge said Tarrio has shown no remorse for his actions. The Spanish women's football team will now be led by the first ever female head coach. She was appointed just hours after her predecessor was fired.  The move comes as part of a major shake up in Spanish football, after the country's football federation chief forcibly kissed a star player after Spain won the Women's World Cup last month. More now from WORLD SPORTS' Patrick Snell.  PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORTS: Well on Tuesday, we learned that Jorge Vilda has been sacked from his role as head coach of Spain's women's team. This amid the ongoing fallout over that unwanted kiss of the now suspended president of the Spanish football federation, Luis Rubiales, gave a player in the aftermath of the Women's World Cup final.  Vilda was the manager who led La Roja to their first ever World Cup triumph recently in Australia. He's gone now and been replaced by former assistant Montse Tome. More on her historic appointment in just a few moments. Now despite Spain's success last month, Vilda's tenure as head coach, he was appointed back in 2015, fair to say it has been hugely controversial.  If we go back to the build up to the World Cup, which saw ongoing unrest between Spain's players, Vilda himself, his coaching staff, and the Spanish federation, it led to 12 of Spain's biggest stars actually missing the World Cup altogether.","What was the reason for Jorge Vilda's firing as the head coach of Spain's women's football team, and who has been appointed as his replacement?","Jorge Vilda was fired as the head coach of Spain's women's football team due to the ongoing fallout from the unwanted kiss that Luis Rubiales, the suspended president of the Spanish football federation, gave a player after the Women's World Cup final.

London maintained a relatively hawkish stance toward Beijing, especially after it imposed the National Security Law on Hong Kong, its former colony, in 2020.  Following the US decision to ban Huawei, a leading Chinese telecoms equipment provider, London followed suit citing national security concerns.    No plans have yet been announced for a meeting between Sunak and Xi, but Cleverly's visit last month made him the most senior British official to visit China since 2018.  He met China's Vice-President Han Zheng and foreign policy Wang Yi during the visit, where the British Foreign Office said he had raised thorny issues such as human rights concerns in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, China's alleged malign cyber activity, Taiwan and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  He also urged Beijing to drop sanctions on some British lawmakers.  Trade between the two countries has been falling in recent years, dropping 5.3 per cent year-on-year in 2022 to US$103.3 billion, according to Chinese customs data. Trade in the first eight months of this year dropped a further 0.6 per cent from a year earlier to US$64.2 billion.

8,"Additionally, they explored avenues for enhanced military collaboration.  Alireza Tangsiri, commander of the IRGC Navy, also indirectly warned Saudi Arabia when he cautioned that ""countries of the region"" should be very careful and vigilant against evil conspiracies and plans of the United States and the Zionist regime.  A MAJOR attack, similar to the 2019 drone and missile strikes on two Saudi oil facilities that shut down half of Saudi oil output, may not be imminent at this stage. This is particularly true given that the two countries recently restarted diplomatic ties. However, symbolic attacks in the form of sabotage or cyber attacks should not be entirely ruled out.  Finally, the IRGC might attempt to plant mines in the Strait of Hormuz, a choke point of global significance. IRGC officials have previously stated, ""If Iran can't export its oil, neither can anyone else."". This wouldn't be the first time the IRGC carried out such a destructive operation. On July 24, 1987, just three days after Reagan initiated the reflag operation known as ""Operation Earnest Will,"" the IRGC planted mines near the Straits of Hormuz. One of these mines exploded and damaged a reflagged Kuwaiti tanker. That mine was potent enough to have sunk one of the US frigates, had it struck the frigate instead of the tanker.  President Biden's decision to dispatch additional Marines and warships to the Persian Gulf is a strategic move to counter the Iranian regime's destabilizing activities. Such a plan requires a strong commitment to retaliate against any attacks on commercial vessels in the Persian Gulf waters. If the US fails to respond decisively, it may be perceived by the regime as weak and indecisive.

8,"However, experts say there is a solution. Allowing free trade and using better varieties of crops that can withstand climate change better can help mitigate future crises.  Growing export curbs. Rice is the staple food of more than half of the world's population and more than 500 million metric tonnes are consumed every year. India accounts for 40 percent of global rice exports, with other key players being Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan and the United States.  The variety of rice – non-parboiled, non-basmati – whose exports have been banned by India formed about 10 percent of the global market in the last two years, Shirley Mustafa, a rice market analyst at the United Nations's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), told Al Jazeera.  This rice ""is destined to very specific regions, including Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Nepal and Bangladesh,"" she said. ""Recently, African buyers have emerged as leaders in buying this type of rice, including Cameroon, Madagascar and Côte d'Ivoire."". But India has also introduced a 20 percent export tax for parboiled rice, in effect enforcing restrictions on all non-basmati rice – 80 percent of the country's total rice exports.  Such export restrictions destabilise the markets, Mustafa said. They lead to a price rise globally, particularly affecting poor countries who look to buy more rice fearing a supply crunch.  To understand the demand for rice, consider what India did last year. In September 2022, India tried to discourage international buying of non-basmati white rice through a tariff to ensure adequate domestic supplies. But the strategy failed. Despite the tax, the export of this variety of rice from India grew by 25 percent between September and March compared with the previous year.  Now, with India banning the export of some rice altogether, global prices have soared further. Rice prices reached their highest levels in July since September 2011, according to the FAO's All Rice Price Index.",How do export restrictions on rice implemented by India impact global rice prices and the availability of rice for other countries?,"Export restrictions on rice implemented by India lead to higher global rice prices and a potential shortage of rice for other countries. As mentioned in the excerpt, India is a major global rice exporter, accounting for 40 percent of global rice exports. By banning the export of certain types of rice and implementing a 20 percent export tax on parboiled rice, India is limiting the availability of rice in the global market. This destabilizes the market and leads to a rise in prices, which particularly affects poor countries that rely on rice imports. The impact of these export restrictions is seen in the soaring rice prices, reaching their highest levels in July since September 2011, according to the FAO's All Rice Price Index.",c9a47d8cd591de7c9a5c36a654f935b6

Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia in cyberspace threaten to spark a real-life clash between the nuclear-armed powers, Moscow's top cybersecurity diplomat has told Newsweek.  At a time when Washington has regularly accused Moscow of using cyber tools—referred to in Russia as information and communication technologies (ICTs)—to pursue illicit aims, Artur Lyukmanov, who serves as both director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's International Information Security Department and special representative to President Vladimir Putin on international cooperation on information security, pointed to a ""lack of hard evidence"" to substantiate such allegations.  Rather, he told Newsweek, ""the U.S. builds up offensive ICT-capabilities, conducts 'hunt-forward' operations against Russia"" and ""employs its clients abroad."". Among those Lyukmanov accused of being involved in such initiatives were the ""IT Army of Ukraine"" that claims to be a volunteer outfit created at the start of Russia's war in Ukraine more than a year and a half ago, and other NATO nations hosting ""cyber laboratories"" in Eastern Europe.  Lyukmanov cited the National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March by President Joe Biden's administration, which allowed for U.S. entities to ""punish those that engage in disruptive, destructive, or destabilizing malicious cyber activity."" The senior Russian official further alleged that U.S. official and corporate entities were ""involved in preparations for 'cognitive warfare,'"" and warned ""such an escalatory path adds higher risks of confrontation."". ""We want to halt further deterioration,"" Lyukmanov said.

(Bloomberg) -- US Vice President Kamala Harris and Chinese Premier Li Qiang are set to meet with leaders at Thursday's summit as they seek to pitch Southeast Asia on competing visions for global security amid brewing regional tensions.  The two donned a traditional Indonesian garment known as batik and exchanged pleasantries with Asian heads of state over dinner in Jakarta on Wednesday after Li earlier in the day urged the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to oppose moves that could lead to a ""new Cold War."" .

Russian public support for Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine has hit an all-time low as the country's presidential election looms, an opinion poll published on Tuesday shows.  Just 38 percent of respondents ""definitely"" support the actions of Russia's Armed Forces in Ukraine, the survey by independent pollster Levada Center conducted late August found.  That's in contrast to results from a February 2022 survey from Levada Center, conducted when Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Results from that poll, which asked the same question, showed 48 percent of respondents said they ""definitely"" supported the army's actions in Ukraine.

The results suggest that 18 months in, Russian public support for Putin's war in Ukraine has dropped significantly—by 14 percentage points. The results are surprising given that in Russia, under stringent laws passed in March 2022, it became illegal to criticize the Russian military and the war in Ukraine. Many are believed to answer public opinion polls on the topic dishonestly, fearing retribution.  Newsweek has contacted Russia's Foreign Ministry via email for comment.  The results come as Russia's 2024 presidential election looms, scheduled to be held on March 17 next year. Putin is expected to soon announce his bid for a sixth overall presidential term. Per constitutional changes made prior to the war in Ukraine, Putin may remain in power until 2036.

Supplying depleted uranium weapons 'criminal act', claims Russia. Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said Washington is committing a ""criminal act"" by supplying depleted Uranium weapons to Ukraine shortly after the Pentagon announced a new batch of military aid for the war-hit country.  The new security assistance package is worth up to $175m and includes depleted uranium ammunition for Abrams tanks, the first time the US is sending the controversial armour-piercing munitions to Kyiv. Depleted uranium is a byproduct of the uranium enrichment process needed to create nuclear weapons.

8,"Iranian hackers target secrets held by defense, satellite and pharmaceutical firms, Microsoft says. CNN   — . Iranian state-backed hackers have targeted satellite, defense and pharmaceutical firms in the US and around the world to gather intelligence and to possibly build out domestic production in those industries amid heavy US sanctions, Microsoft analysts said Thursday.  The hackers have since February successfully broken into a few dozen of the thousands of organizations they have targeted with a blunt hacking technique that underscores the determination of Tehran's hacking teams to access valuable intelligence targets, according to Microsoft.  A heavy regime of US sanctions has sought to cut off Iranian access to military hardware and has, according to a United Nations panel, in some cases deterred Western companies from sending medical supplies to Iran.  Though it's difficult to know exactly why the hackers went after the satellite, defense and pharma firms, the sanctions have increased the incentive for Iran to hunt for trade secrets held by foreign companies, according to Sherrod DeGrippo, Microsoft's director of threat intelligence strategy.  ""Those are sectors where they might have had issues generating the things that they need in-house,"" DeGrippo told CNN.  The cyber-espionage campaign has carried on through the summer amid key moments in US-Iranian relations, including when US officials' accused Iran of helping Russia produce drones for the Ukraine war.  The hackers have been breaking into email accounts by guessing common passwords en masse until one of them works, according to Microsoft. In some cases, the intruders stole data from the victim network; in others they apparently sat quietly and monitored the email accounts for intelligence with the victim none the wiser, according to Microsoft.  The hacking method is about ""compromising an identity,"" DeGrippo said. ""I don't know why they would choose another method if this one's working great for them."". The Iranian government typically denies allegations of hacking. CNN has requested comment from Iran's Permanent Mission to the United Nations.  It's unclear which companies in the US were breached; Microsoft declined to identify them. The US National Security Agency, which helps defense contractors defend themselves from hacks, did not respond do a request for comment.","What industries have Iranian hackers targeted in their cyber-espionage campaign, according to Microsoft analysts?","According to Microsoft analysts, Iranian hackers have targeted the satellite, defense, and pharmaceutical industries.

Marks & Spencer wrote an open letter to the Financial Secretary in partnership with period underwear brand Wuka earlier this month, calling for the removal of VAT from the pants.                       21 Aug 2023-09:07AM GMT                   .                      More than £500m wiped off UK housebuilders as downturn deepens                   . More than half a billion pounds has been wiped off Britain's largest housebuilders amid a deepening downturn in the property sector. . The largest developers across the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 were the biggest fallers today after poor industry data and a major profit warning.  Figures from Rightmove showed asking prices for homes in Britain suffered the biggest August fall  since 2018 this month as soaring mortgage costs put buyers under pressure.  Meanwhile, more than £50m was wiped off the value of Crest Nicholson shares as the housebuilder issued a profit warning today after trading ""worsened during the summer of this year"".  In all, housebuilders have taken a hit of more than £552m in early trading, as Redrow, Vestry, Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon, Barrett and Berkeley sank to the bottom of the UK's main stock markets.  Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor said: ""Shares in Crest Nicholson have had a tough time lately, underperforming the UK market, weighed down by the prospect of ongoing inflation, higher interest rates and subdued borrowing. . ""And the stock is trading sharply lower in today's trade, shedding over 12pc, pricing in the hefty profit downgrade. .",What is the reason behind the recent downturn in the UK property sector?,"The recent downturn in the UK property sector can be attributed to several factors. One of the key factors is the significant fall in asking prices for homes in Britain, which experienced the largest August decline since 2018. This decline is due to soaring mortgage costs, which have put pressure on potential buyers. Additionally, housebuilders have faced challenges, with poor industry data and profit warnings contributing to the downturn. As a result, major housebuilders such as Redrow, Vestry, Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon, Barrett, and Berkeley have seen a significant decrease in their stock market value.",2bec403957e0e1517ab4e027ae105f7b
8,"But since that time, we have departed Afghanistan and Iraq without a victory. In parallel, we spread chaos in Libya and Syria, failing to conclude regime change operations in the latter. American military prowess is no longer undisputed or inevitable, undermining the broader claim of America as the ""sole superpower."" This was all avoidable, but having overextended itself, the visible evidence of American decline is now confirmed. This is what happens when a nation is ruled by disloyal, short-sighted, and foolish people. To state the obvious, losing wars is never good for an empire. The Ottoman and Russian empires dissolved under the stresses of the First World War. While part of the victorious allies, World War II cemented the subordinate status of France and the United Kingdom, and their empires fell apart after the war. Finally, and most recently, the Soviet Union broke apart after its costly and controversial campaign in Afghanistan. Russia's attempts to assert power in its near-abroad fueled America's interest in the current Ukraine War.  The theory was that we would pursue our interests on the cheap, prevent challenges to American hegemony, with the added benefit that Ukrainians would be doing the dying. Because of our military and economic superiority, supporters claimed the war would kill Russians, weaken their military, and destabilize Putin's hold on power. Proponents of the war did not really consider what would happen in the reverse case. What if not Russia, but the United States found itself strained economically, losing critical and hard-to-replace weapons in a war of attrition, visibly demonstrating its impotence and weakness on the world stage? Wouldn't the same dire consequences intended for Russia now happen to us? Indeed, they would. Luckily, actual American security does not depend on the continuation of America's dominance of the globe, nor does American prosperity. Indeed, our prosperity has declined as the requirements of the military industrial complex and the behemoth welfare state devalue our currency and impoverish taxpayers. Further, our aspirations to maintain sole superpower status has endangered us by fueling anti-Americanism, while encouraging significant moral compromise at home.","What are the consequences of losing wars for an empire, according to the author of the excerpt?","According to the author of the excerpt, the consequences of losing wars for an empire are detrimental. They argue that losing wars undermines the claim of being a ""sole superpower"" and diminishes military prowess, which in turn confirms the visible evidence of decline for the empire. The author provides historical examples of empires dissolving under the stresses of war, such as the Ottoman and Russian empires during World War I and the Soviet Union after the controversial campaign in Afghanistan. The excerpt suggests that losing wars can lead to economic strain, loss of critical weapons, demonstration of impotence on the world stage, and potential destabilization of the empire's hold on power.

8,"Russia has doubled its 2023 defence spending target to more than $100 billion - a third of all public expenditure - a government document reviewed by Reuters showed, as the costs of the war in Ukraine spiral and place growing strain on Moscow's finances.  As Russia's military spending soars and sanctions squeeze its energy revenues, Moscow faces a battle to keep its budget deficit in check.  Russia has lost a major chunk of the European gas market but has been able to keep selling its oil to global markets, although the United States, Europe and other powers have limited or ended their purchases.  It has been excluded from Western financial markets, most of its oligarchs are sanctioned, and it is experiencing problems sourcing some items such as microchips.  CIA Director William Burns said earlier this year that Putin risked turning Russia into ""an economic colony of China over time"".  Russia has defaulted on its foreign bonds for the first time since the calamitous months following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.  The invasion and Western sanctions on Russia led to steep rises in the prices of fertiliser, wheat, metals and energy, fuelling an inflationary wave and a global food crisis.  Russia is the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the world's biggest exporter of natural gas, wheat, nitrogen fertiliser and palladium.  Shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, international oil prices spiked to their highest levels since the records of 2008.  Since the invasion, the United States has committed more than $43 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, including stinger anti-aircraft systems, Javelin anti-armour systems, 155mm Howitzers and equipment to protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attack.  The biggest overall supporters of Ukraine in nominal terms are the United States, the European Union, Britain, Germany and Japan, according to The Kiel Institute for the World Economy.  Russia says the West's weapons supplies are escalating the war.",What are some of the factors that are straining Russia's finances and budget deficit?,"Some of the factors that are straining Russia's finances and budget deficit include the soaring military spending, the impact of sanctions on energy revenues, exclusion from Western financial markets, sanctions on oligarchs, and difficulties in sourcing certain items like microchips. According to the excerpt, Russia has doubled its defense spending target to over $100 billion, which accounts for a third of all public expenditure.

So the more chilling headline of this report, Becky is this could be one of the coolest summers of the rest of your life.

8,"Mark Thompson: CNN appoints former BBC director general as chief executive. Ex-BBC and New York Times boss Sir Mark Thompson has been appointed to lead CNN following a series of crises and falling ratings at the US news network.  Sir Mark replaces Chris Licht, who struggled to stabilise CNN in his 13 months as chairman and CEO.  The network has also been through the firings of star anchors Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon, and the closure of streaming service CNN+ after just one month.  Sir Mark must also guide CNN during the 2024 US presidential election.  That challenge will coincide with coverage of criminal charges against Donald Trump.  The network has had a famously tempestuous relationship with the former US president, who unsuccessfully tried to sue CNN for defamation, claiming it had created a ""false and incendiary association"" between him and Adolf Hitler following the last election.  A CNN interview with Mr Trump in May was widely criticised, including by the network's own Christiane Amanpour. Mr Licht stepped down weeks later.  CNN's previous boss Jeff Zucker had been forced to resign in February 2022 after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a senior executive.  'Pivotal time'. David Zaslav, chief executive of parent company Warner Bros Discovery, described Sir Mark as ""a formidable force for CNN and journalism at this pivotal time"".  He added: ""Mark is a true innovator who has transformed for the digital age two of the world's most respected news organizations."". The British executive was director general of the BBC from 2004 to 2012, and is credited with reviving the fortunes of the New York Times by boosting digital subscriptions as president and CEO from 2012 to 2020.  ""I can't wait to roll up my sleeves and get down to work with my new colleagues to build a successful future for CNN,"" Sir Mark said.  His appointment comes days after Warner Bros Discovery announced a new attempt at launching a CNN streaming service, CNN Max, which will combine existing shows with online-only programming.  CNN's cable TV ratings have been dropping faster than those of its competitors, according to official figures quoted by the Associated Press earlier this year.","What challenges will Sir Mark Thompson face as the new CEO of CNN, and what recent developments have contributed to the network's crises and falling ratings?","As the new CEO of CNN, Sir Mark Thompson will face several challenges. One of these challenges is guiding CNN during the 2024 US presidential election, which will coincide with coverage of criminal charges against Donald Trump. This is significant because CNN has had a tempestuous relationship with Trump, including a defamation lawsuit. Additionally, Sir Mark will need to address the falling ratings and series of crises that CNN has recently experienced. This includes the struggles of the previous chairman and CEO, Chris Licht, to stabilize the network, as well as the firings of star anchors Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon. Furthermore, the closure of the streaming service CNN+ after just one month has also contributed to the network's crises.

8,"Barbie v Oppenheimer lures Britons back to struggling cinemas. Films' success pushes admissions to over 17.6m in July and combined takings have passed £130m mark. It was billed as the definitive box office showdown, but the summer phenomenon that was Barbie v Oppenheimer ultimately proved to be the catalyst to get the UK's struggling cinema sector back on track.  The extraordinary success of both films, released on the same day, pushed admissions in July to more than 17.6m – the biggest month for UK cinemagoing since December 2019. And the popularity of ""Barbenheimer"" has continued into this month, with experts predicting 13.5m admissions for August.  Their combined takings are now more than £130m, according to the UK Cinema Association, with further screenings to come over the weekend, a bank holiday in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Directed by Greta Gerwig, Barbie has raked in more than £86m at the UK box office, making it the biggest film of 2023 so far. The first movie launched from toymaker Mattel's newly created in-house film division, it has already overtaken Tom Cruise's blockbuster Top Gun sequel Maverick.  Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer has taken north of £51m, with the two contrasting films combining to give Vue its best weekend since Covid.  The summer's figures are something of a boost to UK cinemas, which have been struggling to recover from closures during the Covid lockdowns. Admissions from May to August are forecast to total about 49.6m – up 8% compared with summer 2022.  However, this is still some way short of 2019, the last full year pre-Covid, when there were 176m admissions, and the 177m in 2018, the highest since 1970. By contrast, in 2020 admission numbers fell to 44m due to the pandemic.  ""For all the positivity, the sector still faces considerable challenges, including cost increases in a range of operating areas, in particular around energy and staffing,"" said Phil Clapp, the chief executive of the UK Cinema Association.","What are some factors contributing to the boost in UK cinema admissions in July, particularly with the success of ""Barbie v Oppenheimer""?","The boost in UK cinema admissions in July can be attributed to the success of ""Barbie v Oppenheimer,"" which was released on the same day.

""Barbie"" alone has made more than £86m, surpassing other blockbusters like Tom Cruise's ""Top Gun"" sequel. The popularity of these films has led to a surge in admissions, with July seeing over 17.6 million cinemagoers, the highest number since December 2019.

8,"Bonnie Garmus wrote 'Lessons in Chemistry,' but for TV it meant changes. Every woman has had an experience like it— or 50, author Bonnie Garmus ventures. It was 2013 and she was a creative director at an advertising agency in the Bay Area when she, the only woman in a pitch meeting for a major technology campaign, received no feedback for her presentation. Then, as she tells it, one of the vice presidents in the room, a man, essentially regurgitated everything she had just outlined and got full credit for the campaign.  ""I put up a fight because I'm not exactly a shrinking violet,"" she says. ""And everyone ignored me. I basically stomped back to my desk. But you know what? It was a really great thing in a way because I was in such a bad mood, that instead of working on the deadline that I was supposed to be working on, I sat down that day, and I wrote the first chapter of 'Lessons in Chemistry.'"". The book follows Elizabeth Zott, a gifted chemist-turned-reluctant TV cooking show sensation who is navigating life as a widowed mother while contending with a sexist 1950s establishment. The emotional thrust of the book didn't need much research. But when it came to the science element, Garmus bought a book on eBay and taught herself basic chemistry from the '50s. ""The fire department had to come twice for the amount of flames in my flat. So, I made some mistakes, but once I got into the chemistry, I was so glad I was forcing myself to do this because if I had not done it, I would have never realized chemistry rules us all,"" she said.  Published in March 2022, a few days before she turned 65, ""Lessons in Chemistry"" is Garmus' debut novel. It quickly became a bestseller, remaining on the New York Times bestsellers list more than a year after publication and has been translated into 40 languages. It's a welcome and unexpected outcome for Garmus, who said the first book she finished and tried to get published was rejected 98 times.","How did Bonnie Garmus's experience in the advertising industry lead to the creation of her novel ""Lessons in Chemistry""?","Bonnie Garmus's experience in the advertising industry, specifically a pitch meeting where she received no feedback and a male colleague took credit for her presentation, led to the creation of her novel ""Lessons in Chemistry.""

8,"Europe: Looking progressive, feeling conservative. Like in the U.S. pre-2022, many countries in Europe have considered themselves ""safe"" and ""progressive"" on the issue, both before and after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. But things are not as simple as they seem.  Close to one-third of women and girls in Europe face challenges in accessing abortion care, according to the European Abortion Politics Atlas. While 21 European countries treat abortion like any other medical service, 16 regulate it through their legal codes, allowing restrictions to be placed on the procedure. Further, in 31 European nations abortion procedures are not covered as part of their national health plan, often making it a financial burden for those who are low income, like undocumented immigrants, Roma people and sex workers.  Many wanting to end pregnancies are forced to travel to find a provider, often resorting to private clinics.  Much of the continent is marked by stark contrasts in access, and slow ebbs of progression and regression. Malta, a majority Catholic country, overturned their total ban on abortions – which had been in the penal code since the 1800s – in November 2022. It happened as a result of an American tourist who sued the country after being denied a life-saving abortion on the island. She had to be airlifted to Spain for the procedure. Still, the change in Malta' legislation is minute – abortion can only be performed to save the mother's life, and mothers must be at true risk of dying to be considered.  On the other hand, San Marino, a Catholic micronation, saw its residents vote an overwhelming 77% in favor of overturning its full ban on abortions in September of 2021. One year later, in September of 2022, the bill to make abortion legal in the first 12 weeks was approved, with the cost covered by San Marino's public health system.  Currently 26 European countries allow healthcare workers to deny abortions based on their personal beliefs, which is a particular issue in Spain: The country liberalized its abortion laws in 2010, allowing abortions up to 14 weeks in any public hospital.","Which European country recently overturned its total ban on abortions, and what are the current restrictions on abortion in that country?","Malta recently overturned its total ban on abortions.

8,"Colombia potential cocaine output rose 24% in 2022 - UN. BOGOTA, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Coca crops in Colombia covered 230,000 hectares (568,000 acres) in 2022, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said on Monday, up 13% from 2021 and at its highest level in more than two decades.  Also at a more than 20-year high was potential cocaine output, which rose 24% to 1,738 metric tonnes.  Coca is the chief ingredient in cocaine, whose production has fueled the Andean country's six-decade armed conflict, which has killed at least 450,000 people.  ""It is worrying that each year there is an increase in coca crops in the country,"" said UNODC Regional Director Candice Welsch during a presentation of the report.  The uptick was due to an increase in crops in Putumayo province, along the border with Ecuador, Welsch said. Production elsewhere was relatively stable.  President Gustavo Petro, Colombia's first leftist president, has pledged to shift the focus of the fight against drugs toward public health, instead of what he says is a failed militarized strategy.  Petro's government wants to help rural communities voluntarily substitute some 100,000 hectares of coca crops over the next four years, an official told Reuters recently.  The president has also promised more social investment in production areas and ruled out a restart to aerial fumigation with herbicide glyphosate.  The fall in the annual growth of coca crops to 13% from 43% in 2021 ""gives elements to continue on with this stabilization, and hopefully decreases,"" Justice Minister Nestor Osuna said at the presentation.  The government wants to reduce cultivation areas to 150,000 hectares and production capacity to 900 metric tonnes by 2026, Osuna said.  Some 13% of Colombia's annual deforestation is linked to illicit crops, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad told a drugs conference last week.  Last year, Colombia's deforestation hit 1,235 square kilometers (477 square miles), down 29% from 2021.",What factors contributed to the increase in coca crops and potential cocaine output in Colombia in 2022?,"The increase in coca crops and potential cocaine output in Colombia in 2022 was primarily due to an increase in crops in Putumayo province, along the border with Ecuador.

The UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update on Monday that at least five regiments of Russia's elite parachute force, the VDV, ""are likely now concentrated within several kilometers of the frontline village of Robotyne."". At full strength, this would be about 10,000 paratroopers, the MOD said. ""However, almost all units are highly likely dramatically under strength,"" it said.  The situation is one that is unlikely to please the elite force's hierarchy, it added. . The VDV forces have likely reinforced Russia's 58th Combined Arms Army, part of Russia's ground forces, according to the UK MOD, with the situation coming about as Russia's military finds itself overstretched.

0,"""It's a slow, slow process"", said McMichael-Phillips. ""The game changer will be uncrewed technology, where you can operate a vessel almost 24/7, without any people on board."". AI is 'the future'. This is why ocean researchers have big hopes for artificial intelligence. Seacraft, such as submersibles, that operate autonomously by themselves, could take away a lot of the manpower needed to explore the vast reaches of our oceans.  ""A remotely operated underwater vehicle, controlled from a distance by a human pilot, works well when you need to inspect a specific object, like the base of an offshore wind turbine,"" said Helge Renkewitz, a researcher at the German research institute Fraunhofer working on underwater robotics. ""But if you want to explore large stretches of the seafloor, autonomous vehicles are the future."". Autonomous, AI-powered submersibles would minimise the risks to human lives from deep-sea exploration and would allow faster mapping of ocean floors. But what researchers ideally want is to go one step further: build submersibles that can explore for indefinite stretches of time, thereby speeding up the process of scanning the planet's deepest spots.  That, according to Renkewitz, is difficult because the deep sea comes with several engineering challenges.  First, there's the corrosiveness of salt water, which makes it hard for submersibles to survive undamaged for long unless they are made of high-tech materials like titanium steel. Then there's the pressure. The deeper you go under water, the more pressure is directed at an object. This proved fatal for the Titan submersible.  ""At the depth of the Titanic wreck, almost 4,000 metres deep, a craft experiences 5,689 pounds [2,580kg] of pressure per square inch,"" said Renkewitz. That's 400 times the average pressure we experience at sea level.  And then there are the challenges that autonomous vehicles face in navigating the terrain deep under water.  On the surface, a self-driving car can use sensors to look around and recognise things. It can also rely on precise satellite positioning systems like GPS.","What are the advantages of using autonomous, AI-powered submersibles in ocean exploration?","The advantages of using autonomous, AI-powered submersibles in ocean exploration are that they can minimize the risks to human lives from deep-sea exploration and allow for faster mapping of ocean floors.

But his shenanigans here come on top of a litany of previous dubious deeds and misuse of his office over the years that call into question his fitness for the office he holds. . Perhaps most notably, Jordan himself refused to cooperate with the Jan. 6 House Select Committee's investigations despite having critically important information, including his contacts with Trump about the events of that terrible day. Ironically, Jordan suggested that the request to question him was ""far outside the bounds of any legitimate inquiry, violates core constitutional principles and would serve to further erode legislative norms."". Willis should call Jordan's bluff and remind him of those words here— and that as the Supreme Court has put it, ""the National Government, anxious though it may be to vindicate and protect federal rights and federal interests, always endeavors to do so in ways that will not unduly interfere with the legitimate activities of the States."" . If it comes to litigation, the courts will see through Jordan's efforts for the distracting and partisan political theatrics they are. The careful balance of power between the states and the federal government — although long debated ever since our nation's founding and in the decades following — is now well-defined in all but the most extreme circumstances.

Ascertain and Northwell will tackle discharge notes, billing. When Michalski and Richard Mulry, the CEO of Northwell's for-profit arm, recently met with Northwell leaders overseeing billing, supply chains, patient-care transitions, and more, the administrative burden on providers was crystal-clear. . Providers and hospital workers spend hours each day on paperwork and reading. The tasks vary, but fundamentally, they involve sifting through huge quantities of information to write down or otherwise communicate the relevant bits to each other, patients, and health plans. . Michalski said that generative-AI models, which can create humanlike text and other content based on patterns they learn from data, are tailor-made for that challenge.  Michalski said that since he joined Ascertain on July 7, the team has already spun up a tool for creating discharge paperwork.  The team at Northwell that deals with billing health plans is also interested in taking advantage of AI, Mulry said. Billing is currently a painful, manual process — the rules vary from plan to plan, and they change often, leading to unpaid bills and wasted time, Mulry added. . AI could help by supporting some kind of process that keeps workers apprised of health plans' web of rules around paying for care, he said.  ""Doctors should be for patients,"" Michalski said. ""And paperwork should be for these bots to solve."". Ascertain faces steep competition. Northwell's work with Aegis is a fairly unique attempt to combine leading technology talent with the vast insights of a giant health system. . The studio is providing $100 million in seed funding to two joint ventures with Northwell's for-profit arm: Ascertain and Caire, which is focused on telehealth.

So the establishment, the anti-Trump establishment will be saying, get out if you're not succeeding.

Indigenous Peoples demanding access to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) welcomed the target set Thursday by the international council to fund Indigenous practices as part of the ratification of the Global Biodiversity Framework Fund (GBFF). . Environment and Climate Change Minister Steven Guilbeault announced Canada will contribute $200 million to the fund, with 20 per cent allocated for Indigenous Peoples. Prior to the GBFF ratification, Indigenous Peoples were demanding direct access to 20 per cent of the GEF fund in order to fund the autonomous management of their territories' biodiversity, and now, for the first time, will have access to international climate funds. . However, there are lingering concerns that the language of the framework, which cites the 20 per cent for Indigenous Peoples goal as ""aspirational,"" could limit Indigenous access without a fixed funding target. Canada's leadership in advancing Indigenous access to funds is positive, but without the assured language, other countries might not necessarily follow Canada's steps, Oscar Soria, campaign director for activist group Avaaz, told Canada's National Observer. . The word ""aspirational"" in diplomacy terms is what Soria refers to as ""constructive ambiguity."" Soria explains it like this: Say you and a friend go to the cinema and you want to see Barbie, while your friend wants to see Oppenheimer. Under constructive ambiguity, both of you would only decide together to go to the cinema to see an American movie, but a real decision will not be made until you reach the ticket booth. .

""You also have that situation in which sometimes the funds are awarded not based on merit, but based on politics,"" he explained.   .

Similar anxiety over TikTok, developed by China's ByteDance, animates Western political debate -- with some lawmakers calling for an outright ban on the app over data security fears.  - Industrial and military espionage -. Beijing has leaned on Chinese citizens abroad to gather intelligence and steal sensitive technology, according to experts, US lawmakers and media reports.

Ji was accused of supplying information about eight people to the Jiangsu province security ministry, an intelligence unit accused of engaging in the theft of US trade secrets.  Last year, a US court sentenced a Chinese intelligence officer to 20 years in prison for stealing technology from US and French aerospace firms.  The man, named Xu Yanjun, was found guilty of playing a leading role in a five-year Chinese state-backed scheme to steal commercial secrets from GE Aviation, one of the world's leading aircraft engine manufacturers, and France's Safran Group.

Arévalo unexpectedly emerged out of political obscurity to build a large anti-corruption movement with his Semilla party, after many other opposition candidates were barred from running. His victory marks a repudiation of Guatemala's established political parties that wield huge influence.  When Arévalo landed a surprise second-place finish in June's first round of voting, official results were delayed as opponents alleged irregularities and his party was briefly suspended at the request of a prominent prosecutor before Guatemala's top court reversed the ban.  Risa Grais-Targow, an analyst at the political risk consultancy firm Eurasia Group, said she expected attacks on Arévalo to continue. ""The ruling pact will likely continue to target electoral officials and Arévalo's Semilla party with investigations ahead of January's change in government,"" she added.  Beyond his anti-corruption policies, Arévalo said he wanted to expand relations with China alongside Guatemala's longstanding allegiance with Taiwan. How he plans to do that remains to be seen, given China's policy that no country it has ties with can maintain separate diplomatic relations with Taipei.  This year, Honduras became the latest country in the region to switch allegiance from Taiwan to China.  There were no reports of violence or disorderliness at the polls.

Eladio Loizaga, the head of the mission, said the election had ""fulfilled all the demanding obligations"".

0,"US praises G-20 statement on Ukraine, even if it's softer than hoped. Leaders managed to agree on a joint statement laying out shared views on climate change and economic development but showed the fractures within the group by stopping short of explicitly condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Diplomats had been working furiously to draft a final joint statement in the lead-up to the summit but hit snags on language to describe the Ukraine war. Officials said they worked through 300 hours of meetings and went through 15 drafts to arrive at an eventual consensus.  The eventual compromise statement amounted to a coup for the summit's host, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but still reflected a position far softer than those the United States and its Western allies have adopted individually.  ""All states must refrain from the threat or use of force to seek territorial acquisition,"" the declaration read, without explicitly singling out Russia for its invasion. The document also stated opposition to the use of nuclear weapons and highlighted the economic effects of the war.  In a reflection of the deep fractures among the G20 nations, the statement acknowledged ""there were different views and assessments of the situation."". The declaration earned the praise of the United States. National security adviser Jake Sullivan called the statement a ""significant milestone for India's chairmanship and a vote of confidence that the G20 can come together to address a pressing range of issues."". ""The G20 statement includes a set of consequential paragraphs on the war in Ukraine. And from our perspective, it does a very good job of standing up for the principle that states cannot use force to seek territorial acquisition,"" Sullivan said.  Still, the language differed from last year's G20 declaration, which stated ""most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine."". Russia, as a member of the G20, would have to agree on any consensus statement on Ukraine. Russia and China had resisted stronger language in a final statement, making any kind of agreement difficult. No G20 summit has concluded without a joint declaration of some type.  Ukraine's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko criticized the declaration.  ""Ukraine is grateful to its partners who tried to include strong wording in the text,"" he wrote on Facebook.",What is the stance of the G20 leaders on Russia's invasion of Ukraine?,"The G20 leaders, as reflected in their joint statement, stopped short of explicitly condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

New York (CNN) — Tropical Storm Hilary slammed into the Western US this weekend, becoming the first tropical storm to cross California is a quarter century and Nevada's first tropical storm. Multiple areas of Southern California broke rain records, with Downtown Los Angeles experiencing the rainiest summer day on record. Roads across the state are inundated with water, mud and debris.  But while the roughly 39 million residents of the Golden State are accustomed to wildfires and earthquakes, when it comes to flood insurance there were only about 194,000active policies in the state as of July 31, according to data from the Federal Emergency Management Service. . The city of Palm Springs - with a population of about 45,000 - saw nearly a full-year's worth of rain in just 24 hours. Meanwhile, there are only 167 active flood insurance policies in Palm Springs, according to FEMA.  Life-threatening flash flooding in areas that don't normally flood - as well as predictions more frequent extreme weather events - are deadly reminders of the importance of flood insurance.  But while the policies can be vital in protecting many households' largest assets, flood insurance is still poorly understood and often passed over. Here's what you need to know about it.  What is flood insurance?. Flood insurance is a type of policy that protects renters, homeowners, and business owners from damage caused by flooding.  These policies are not usually included in homeowners insurance, but they can cover harm to the integrity of the building itself and loss of belongings inside. Flood insurance for renters only covers the contents of their home.  In the United States, FEMA has traditionally provided all flood insurance plans through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). That means that even a plan through a company like GEICO is backed by the federal government.  ""Flooding is the most common disaster across America,"" said David Maurstad, senior executive of the National Flood Insurance Program. ""Insured survivors are more resilient and recover more quickly following a disaster.  Is FEMA flood insurance enough?.","Why are flood insurance policies often overlooked, despite the frequency of flooding and extreme weather events?","Flood insurance policies are often overlooked despite the frequency of flooding and extreme weather events because they are poorly understood. Many residents in areas prone to flooding, such as California, are more familiar with wildfires and earthquakes and may not realize the importance of flood insurance.

The excerpt states that there are only about 194,000 active flood insurance policies in California, despite its large population, highlighting the low adoption rate.",2c524f1997b3a962611754da0769a1c0

This will redefine the role of institutions of higher education in our lives and society, as these institutions will emerge as centers of continuous and sustained workforce development critical to the economy.  Kristen DiCerbo: AI will allow teachers to be more human. Kristen DiCerbo, Ph.D. is the chief learning officer at Khan Academy. She has spent most of her career designing and researching digital learning environments.  Within the education system, teachers are often being asked to do too much and, in some places for some subjects, there are teacher shortages. The promise of AI in education is that we can free up teachers' time by providing them assistance to complete labor-intensive activities, such as lesson planning, rubric creation, and even feedback and grading.  An AI teaching assistant, for example, can offer students more frequent and immediate feedback on their writing, and can ask them to explain their steps on a math problem. Students learn best when they get a chance to practice new skills and get immediate feedback on their efforts, but this is impossible with one teacher and large class sizes.  Teachers help students achieve a sense of belonging in school, see themselves as capable of success, and act as architects of their own future. Artificial intelligence cannot do any of that.  Kristen DiCerbo. So AI will really become an extension of the teacher rather than a replacement. Systems based on large language models, like chatbots, can help teachers differentiate lessons for learners at different levels. It can reduce the amount of time teachers spend on planning by serving as a partner in creating lesson plans, brainstorming class activities and drafting quizzes.  Spending less time on these tasks does not mean we need fewer teachers. It means teachers have more time to build relationships with students. Studies show that strong relationships with teachers and school staff help increase students' motivation and academic engagement. Teachers help students achieve a sense of belonging in school, see themselves as capable of success, and act as architects of their own future. Artificial intelligence cannot do any of that.  National assessment results are not where we want them to be.

However, it was his grandson, Konrad Birkenstock, who introduced the first contoured insole in 1896, setting the stage for the brand's emphasis on comfort and foot health. The development of the Madrid sandal by Karl Birkenstock in 1964 marked a turning point, featuring a flexible cork footbed that would shape the brand's future. While the brand gained popularity among those seeking comfort, it wasn't until the 1990s that its unique aesthetic began to impact the fashion world. Embraced by grunge culture for its practicality, Birkenstock's design gained attention from those who appreciated its unconventional charm. Celebrity endorsements played a pivotal role in Birkenstock's journey. Figures like Kate Moss, Gigi Hadid, Leonardo DiCaprio and Steve Jobs championed the brand, elevating it from everyday comfort wear to the heights of red carpets and fashion runways. Collaborations with luxury brands such as Celine and Givenchy solidified Birkenstock's status as a coveted accessory in the fashion world.  Just recently, Bloomberg predicted that the company would go public with a valuation of $8 million and Lyst reported that searches for the sandal had gone up by 110%; this boost in popularity was because of its recent appearance in the summer hit 'Barbie' where actress Margot Robbie dons a pair.

That variant initially spread quickly but did not overwhelm populations at a significant scale. The same report noted that it has been detected by surveillance labs in Israel and Denmark and later in labs in England, South Africa, and the United States. According to Fortune, new data released on Twitter on Friday evening by Ben Murrell, a researcher at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, showed that blood samples taken last week performed better than expected when it came to neutralising BA.2.86. Dr Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research and founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said in a tweet that the findings offer a more positive outlook for how new boosters might protect against the highly mutated variant. So far, no deaths have been reported among cases, according to the WHO. As of last week, an elderly man in Europe was hospitalised with the strain, according to Fortune.

2,"The two have closed ranks over the last 18 months. North Korea, for instance, has been one of the few countries (along with Syria and Belarus) to call Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine a justifiable, if not necessary, reaction to U.S. containment policies against Moscow. The talking points rehearsed by North Korean state media are practically identical to what you might hear from Russian propagandists. While there is little at stake in Ukraine for Kim Jong-un, he has nonetheless exploited the war and leveraged Russia's pressing need for munitions and artillery to his advantage. This serves a short-term practical need in the form of mitigating North Korea's food shortages while accomplishing one of North Korea's long-term objectives—undermining Washington's policy agenda on the Korean peninsula and in Asia writ large.  Unfortunately for the U.S., there isn't much it can do to rectify this situation. Due to decades of adversarial relations with Pyongyang, U.S. leverage over North Korea is extremely limited. If Kim Jong-un were begging for negotiations with the U.S., then perhaps the Biden administration could press the point. But Kim simply isn't interested in talks and may have given up on the current U.S. administration anyway. So Washington is left with a familiar but worn-out tool in its North Korea policy toolkit: economic sanctions. On August 16, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned three entities involved in supporting arms deals between Moscow and Pyongyang.  But let's be honest: this is the equivalent of a band-aid on a fire hydrant. As much as we would like to tell ourselves otherwise, the U.S. isn't all-powerful.  Daniel R.

""I guess they say that she was after a certain gang and she ended up having an affair with the head of the gang or a gang member. And this is a person that wants to indict me."" He offered no evidence for his salacious allegation. Willis has called it derogatory and false. Multiple news organizations have debunked it. Nevertheless, it is mentioned in a Trump campaign ad now running on Atlanta TV.

Trump launched his 2016 presidential bid labeling Mexicans illegally crossing the Southern border criminals and rapists. His presidency was bookended by blanket accusations leveled at Muslims and the Chinese. Now, as Trump contends with four criminal indictments and three other civil inquiries or cases to boot, his attacks on prosecutors, judges, and others associated with the process amount to a high-intensity extension of those tactics.","What baseless allegation did Donald Trump make about Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, and how has she responded to it?",Donald Trump made the baseless allegation that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had an affair with or was involved with the head of a gang.

The former president opted to not participate in the Republican debate, pointing to his poll numbers that show him with a substantial lead over his challengers. In the weeks leading up to the debate, he questioned why a candidate with such a lead would debate his rivals. FiveThirtyEight's polling aggregate shows him with a nearly 38-point lead over his second-place rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.  The X metric only measures the number of people who saw the post, even fleetingly. It does not measure how many actually watched the interview, or how long it was watched, with platform owner Elon Musk having removed the ability to measure video views earlier this year.  Above, an image shows a preview of Tucker Carlson's interview of former US President Donald Trump scheduled to air on X (formerly Twitter) on the same night of the first Republican Presidential primary debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on August 23, 2023. Trump's interview was viewed nearly 100 million times in four hours. CHRIS DELMAS/AFP via . Still, the interview, which aired on X at the same time the other candidates took the stage, quickly became Carlson's most-watched interview.  His interview with social media personality and alleged human trafficker Andrew Tate was previously Carlson's most-viewed interview at 107 million views since it was posted on July 11. The Trump interview had reached 100 million views by 1 a.m. ET, only four hours after it was posted.  The video has also been liked more than 438,000 times and reposted more than 124,000 times, as of the same time.","Why did former President Donald Trump choose to participate in an interview with Tucker Carlson instead of attending the Republican primary election, and how many views did the interview receive on the social media platform X?","Former President Donald Trump chose to participate in an interview with Tucker Carlson instead of attending the Republican primary election because his polling numbers showed him with a substantial lead over his rivals, and he questioned the necessity of debating them.

""With the high levels of uncertainty and volatility that we see all around us, it makes a lot of sense … to seek this alignment of potential allies around the values and the objectives that we as North American countries already have."". But uncertainty and volatility are precisely why reopening such a hard-won agreement could be a non-starter, said former diplomat Louise Blais, an adviser for the Business Council of Canada. . ""There is no consensus in the U.S. government on this issue. I would not even qualify this discussion as having hit Main Street, despite Sen. Cassidy's efforts,"" Blais said. . The agreement requires all three parties to take part in a mandated review in 2026 and agree to maintain it, and most Canadian advocates agree that getting through that process unscathed is Job 1. . While the council is a strong advocate for trade and investment throughout the Americas, Blais said the priority is renewing the deal, not amending it. . Mary Ng, Canada's international trade minister, has already been lobbying hard for prompt trilateral endorsement. A statement from Global Affairs Canada late Thursday made clear that view hasn't changed. . ""In its current form, the agreement contains no mechanisms to allow other countries to join in,"" said spokesperson Geneviève Tremblay. . ""The addition of new partners to CUSMA is not something officials have discussed with the United States or Mexico. We are currently focused on full implementation, along with our current CUSMA partners."". Baker's report doesn't linger on the question of which Latin American countries ought to be invited to the North American trade party, but there are already obvious candidates with strong trade ties to the U.S. . Aside from Canada and Mexico, the countries currently taking part in the APEP framework discussions include Barbados, the Dominican Republic, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, Ecuador and Costa Rica. .",What is the current stance of Canada and Mexico in relation to the United States and the North American trade agreement?,"Canada and Mexico are currently seen as the preferred partners of the United States in the North American trade agreement, according to a statement from Baker.

This time, police say a detainee killed and two others injured after a mass stabbing on Thursday. This is the fifth death of a jail inmate there since the end of July.  The Justice Department has launched a civil rights investigation into the jail for dilapidated and unsanitary conditions, as well as violence against detainees.  It's also, of course, the same jail where Donald Trump turned himself in last week and had his first-ever mug shot taken there after being indicted on criminal charges in the Georgia election subversion and racketeering case, to which he's now pleaded not guilty.

So help us understand why lawyers would be saying we should sever his case from the other defendants.  TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL, JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE: So there are several reasons why you may want to sever your case. One is that you want to go more quickly than others. And here, for example, Kenneth Chesebro, he's saying, Judge, I want to activate my speedy trial rights act now. I want to move forward as quickly as possible. I want a trial in October.

May your country India, Sir, never be caught by the encircling gloom,"" warned Carlos P. Romulo, during one of the most profound and equally prescient exchanges during the Bandung Conference.  His counterpart was no less than Jawaharlal Nehru, India's legendary statesman, who insisted on building a common post-colonial front with Maoist China against both the capitalist West as well as Soviet Communism. Just a few years later, Romulo, an anti-communist liberal, was brutally vindicated, when China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) pierced through disputed Himalayan borders and inflicted a humiliating defeat on India.  According to Romulo, Nehru, bedridden in his twilight years, acknowledged his fatal mistake, reportedly telling his Filipino counterpart during an emotional reunion in New Delhi: ""General Romulo, how right you were at Bandung! And how wrong was I."". The Bandung Conference (1955) was a watershed moment in modern history, especially for dozens of newly liberated nations, who suddenly found themselves painfully vulnerable amid a raging Cold War between Washington and Moscow. Eager to preserve the hard-earned independence of new, fragile nations, Sukarno, Indonesia's swashbuckling founding father, gathered leaders from across Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America.  Almost all nations in attendance had suffered from one form of Western colonialism or the other. Ancient powers from China to Persia had been humiliated, while the likes of India were fully colonized. Thus, rejection of Western neocolonial advances was a de facto consensus among all those in attendance. But as historian Lisandro Claudio explains, the sticking point was ""[t]he categorization of the Soviet Union as [an] imperialist [power]."".",What was the purpose of the Bandung Conference and what was the consensus among the attendees regarding Western neocolonial advances?,"The purpose of the Bandung Conference was to bring together leaders from newly liberated nations in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America to discuss and address the challenges they faced in the midst of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. The attendees at the conference shared a consensus in rejecting Western neocolonial advances. This rejection stemmed from the historical experiences of colonization and humiliation suffered by many of the nations present, including China, Persia, and India.

2,"This means that the average household bill will end up at around £1,923 per year, according to the regulator's calculations, which is £151 lower than its previous cap. . Because the cap decides the per unit charge, households that use more will pay more.

Household energy bills will fall by around £151 a year as the price shock caused by Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine eases further.  The cap-which limits the amount that a supplier can charge per unit of gas or electricity they sell-will fall to £1,923 from October 1, down from an average of £2,074.  Although it is down from the £2,500 families paid last winter once government subsidies were taken into account, it is still well above the £1,138 that came in February 2022 before Russia invaded Ukraine and triggered a shock to global supplies.  While annual bills are set to fall, seven million households will actually have higher heating bills this winter amid increases in standing order charges and the loss of government subsidies, according to the Resolution Foundation. . Last winter the average household energy bill was £2,500 per year, thanks to the Government's Energy Price Guarantee scheme, meaning the Treasury covered the extra cost of the price cap, which stood at £4,279 in January.  Households were also getting £66 per month taken off their bills by the Government.  On Thursday, Ofgem was accused of allowing energy companies to ramp up ""unfair"" charges after analysts warned that more than seven million households face higher heating bills this winter.  Our deputy economics editor Tim Wallace has the details:.

Therefore, it is imperative that the region make a concerted effort to design policies that promote sustainability and inclusive growth to mitigate the problem of hunger and poverty in the face of climate change.  Fabio Gómez Delgado, of the Universidad Javeriana in Colombia, stresses that the possibility of achieving the initial economic and social development goals in an environment of climate change cannot be seen in a very positive light, so countries that are not prepared would have to reevaluate them and find other strategies.  The World Bank, for example, believes that it is key for the region to promote green growth and more resilient cities, while enabling vulnerable populations to adapt to climate change.  It is also considered essential to decarbonize power generation, transportation systems and manufacturing, an area in which Latin America has taken important steps, but further efforts will be required to see results.  Between 2015 and 2020 renewable energy capacity in Latin America increased by a significant 33%. Already by 2021, 58% of electricity generation in the region was projected to come from renewable sources.  However, Latin America and the Caribbean will need to accelerate in that direction by harnessing hydroelectric potential, as well as untapped solar and wind resources, while electricity demand could grow by 48% by 2030.  ""If we fail to limit climate change to 2°C, overcoming poverty and hunger will be much more difficult. In fact, investing in climate change mitigation and adaptation has benefits over all other sustainable development goals.

But he added that they can be extremely effective when designed within a broader package to tackle food insecurity in cities – a challenge which will only grow as urbanisation accelerates. . ""They have a really key role in redistributing food and serving the vulnerable … but I think the problems come in when they are seen as the solution,"" he said. . Dr Haysom pointed to Belo Horizonte, a city home to 2.5 million people in southeast Brazil, as a gold standard. Since the early 1990s, the government has rolled out a food security programme which combines immediate aid with programmes to boost production, create employment, and regulate prices for some staple products at markets. . ""Food banks are a part of it, but the city is also tackling the deeper systemic drivers of food insecurity,"" Dr Haysom said.

Now, the man who is taking over Rustem Umerov is widely praised here in Ukraine.  He's considered an extremely safe place, pair of hands. He's had extensive knowledge of so much of this for being involved, as he has been in some of the prisoner of war exchanges. But he's also taking over at a crucial time, because what we understand from President Zelenskyy, what he's been saying these last few days and weeks is that September is going to be an extremely busy period.  Not just as Ukrainian forces try and press ahead with their counter offensive, but also in terms of asking Western allies for more weaponry that will allow them, they believe, to make the difference when it comes to their frontlines. So this man is taking over at a critical time, both in terms of what Ukraine is going to be asking allies for.  But also about what Ukraine is trying to do in terms of its own weapons capability, bringing weapons that are able to bring this war to Russia itself.

Umerov is considered to be a safe and knowledgeable choice for this position, given his involvement in prisoner of war exchanges and his understanding of the ongoing conflict. Additionally, Umerov's appointment is seen as an opportunity to address and address the corruption scandals that have plagued Ukraine's Defense Ministry in recent months.

Even members of the United States Congress have lent credence to that concept. But that is an imperfect analogy. .  As many have pointed out, China is a peer economy to the US and is likely to overtake it in gross domestic product (GDP) soon, while the former Soviet Union's economy was, at its peak, only a third that of the US.

Q: What moment/deal would you cite as the 'game changer' or turning point for the company?. A: When we initially started building our application, communications technologies such as Skype were only just starting to emerge.  What we were trying to achieve was both complex and very cutting edge – video of candidate, video of their screen, instant messaging, delivery of the exam, everything recorded, etc.  Particularly when it comes to high-stakes exams, there isn't an option to have bugs. It took us about two years to develop the application, and it was a huge turning point when we successfully ran our first live exams back in early 2015.  Q: To what extent does your business trade internationally, and what are your future plans/ambitions?. A: Although we run a lot of exams in Ireland for organisations like the Royal College of Physicians, the Insurance Institute and the Institute of Banking, most of our business comes from UK awarding bodies and Royal Medical Colleges (75 per cent).  We have never actively targeted the US, but plan to do so next year as part of our growth plans.  Q: What is your growth funding path?. A: Aside from a very small amount of HPSU [high potential start-up] funding from Enterprise Ireland, which was matched by friends and family when we first started the company, TestReach has been boot-strapped, and all growth has been funded by revenue.  That said, we continually review our growth plans and may look to take on some funding next year in line with our US expansion plan.  Q: What are the big disruptive forces in your industry?.","According to the excerpt, what are the future plans and ambitions of TestReach?","According to the excerpt, TestReach's future plans and ambitions include targeting the US market for growth. Currently, most of their business comes from UK awarding bodies and Royal Medical Colleges. However, they have not actively targeted the US yet but plan to do so next year as part of their growth plans. They may also consider taking on funding next year to support their expansion into the US market.",07e4d37bec880f411cbfe0c894139fb5
2,"When scientists fail to do this, they are no longer practising science, and any support that their education or credentials might seem to offer for their unevidenced position is entirely illusory.  In Dearlove's defence, his frustration stems in part from recognition that a false aura of scientific respectability bamboozles the unwary, noting that ""when you are an authoritative scientist in this area, and you put forward an extreme view – people listen to you"".  This observation is undoubtedly correct, and a minority of individual scientists can and do make assertions contrary to best evidence. Worse again, as scientists and doctors are among the most trusted members of society, they can do considerable damage when they champion unevidenced positions.  Andrew Wakefield's campaign at the turn of the millennium falsely linking the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine to autism is an infamous example of precisely this. While such assertions were even at the time utterly unsupported by reliable evidence, Wakefield's trusted position as a physician-scientist helped his assertions dominate headlines, leaving a legacy of harm that persists even today, long after his work was exposed as fraudulent.  There is a crucial distinction between utterances of individual scientists and the position of the wider scientific community. Dearlove's statement that ""lots of supposedly brilliant scientists, and they are brilliant, said all sorts of things during the pandemic... and we now discover a lot of what they were saying was scientifically off-piste, wrong"" betrays this fundamental error. In missing this distinction, Dearlove overshoots healthy scepticism and dives straight into heady cynicism.  There is a world of difference between the sometimes unsupported opinions of individual scientists and the collective consensus of scientific authorities like the World Health Organization or the National Health Service. Scientific bodies carefully assess all available evidence, debating and weighing it to arrive at an informed position. The resultant scientific consensus is far more robust than individual positions, and typically the basis for policy decisions.  Even with a collective of experts, scientific advice is never static. This is precisely how science should proceed, as self-correction is a vital hallmark of scientific endeavour. Advice on masks for Covid is a case in point.","What is the difference between the opinions of individual scientists and the position of scientific authorities, and why is the collective consensus of scientific authorities considered more robust?","The difference between the opinions of individual scientists and the position of scientific authorities is that individual scientists may sometimes express unsupported opinions, as seen in the example of Andrew Wakefield falsely linking the MMR vaccine to autism. On the other hand, scientific authorities, such as the World Health Organization or the National Health Service, carefully assess all available evidence, engage in debate, and arrive at a collective consensus that is considered more robust. This consensus is based on a thorough evaluation of the evidence and is typically the basis for policy decisions. The reason the collective consensus is considered more robust is because it represents the culmination of rigorous scientific analysis and review by a diverse group of experts, providing a more reliable and comprehensive understanding of a given issue. This collective approach also allows for self-correction and adaptation as new evidence emerges, ensuring that scientific advice remains up-to-date and reliable.",a87e82f6e0c1e3a05bd62301ec77726c

WHY IN NEWS?. — With banks enabling the interoperability of Unified Payments Interface's (UPI) Quick Response (QR) code with their central bank digital currency (CBDC) or e₹ application, users of retail digital rupee will be able to make transactions by scanning any UPI QR at a merchant outlet. Merchants can also accept digital rupee payments through their existing UPI QR codes.  KEY TAKEAWAYS. Hitesh Vyas Explains: . — This integration of UPI and CBDC is part of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) ongoing pilot project on pushing the retail digital rupee.  What is interoperability?. — Interoperability is the technical compatibility that enables a payment system to be used in conjunction with other payment systems, according to the RBI. Interoperability allows system providers and participants in different systems to undertake, clear and settle payment transactions across systems without participating in multiple systems. Interoperability between payment systems contributes to achieving adoption, co-existence, innovation, and efficiency for end users.  What is UPI QR code-CBDC interoperability?. — Interoperability of UPI with the digital rupee means all UPI QR codes are compatible with CBDC apps. Initially, when the pilot for the retail digital rupee was launched, the e₹-R users had to scan a specific QR code to undertake transactions. However, with the interoperability of the two, payments can be made using a single QR code. The digital rupee issued by the RBI, or the CBDC, is a tokenised digital version of the rupee. The e₹ is held in a digital wallet, which is linked to a customer's existing savings bank account. UPI is directly linked to a customer's account.",What is the purpose of the interoperability between UPI QR codes and the retail digital rupee in India?,The purpose of the interoperability between UPI QR codes and the retail digital rupee in India is to enable users to make transactions using the retail digital rupee by scanning any UPI QR code at a merchant outlet. This integration allows merchants to accept digital rupee payments through their existing UPI QR codes. It is a part of the Reserve Bank of India's pilot project on pushing the retail digital rupee and aims to achieve compatibility and efficiency for end users by allowing different payment systems to work together seamlessly.,a187a4dfaea06dc075f8872deb91957b

2,"While Kyiv has never taken any public responsibility for these attacks, it has never not denied striking targets inside Russia.  White House says Putin and Kim Jong Un traded letters as Russia looks for munitions from North Korea. The White House on Wednesday said that it has new intelligence that shows Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have swapped letters as Russia looks to North Korea for munitions for the Ukraine war.  National Security Council spokesman John Kirby detailed the latest finding just weeks after the White House said that it had determined that Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu during a recent visit to Pyongyang called on North Korean officials to increase the sale of munitions to Moscow for its war in Ukraine.  Kirby said that Russia is looking for additional artillery shells and other basic materiel to shore up Russia's defense industrial base.  Aamer Madhani has the full story:. The key to Ukraine punching through Russia's defences – and putting Putin's forces on the back foot. Long-range strikes by drone and missile and a raid on territory in occupied Crimea that took Russian forces by surprise – all part of Kyiv's recent push towards the peninsula that is a symbol of Vladimir Putin's territorial ambitions.  Perhaps most significant of all is the capture of the key village of Robotyne, about three hours drive east of Crimea. Gaining that foothold will help Ukraine build a foundation to punch through to the coastline of the Sea of Azov.  Kyiv has been stepping up drone attacks on Crimea as it looks to break key supply lines from the Russian-occupied peninsula, writes Askold Krushelnycky in Ukraine:. Russia earns less from oil and spends more on war. So far, sanctions are working like a slow poison.

Additionally, modern drones have the capability to change shape in flight by unfolding wings, arms, or propellers, further adding to the confusion.

2,"California sues oil giants alleging 'climate risks deception': Report. Five oil majors are accused of downplaying the risks posed by fossil fuels since the 1950s, The New York Times reports.  The US state of California has sued five oil giants for their alleged role in downplaying the risk posed by fossil fuels while causing tens of billions of dollars in damage, The New York Times has reported.  The lawsuit, filed on Friday in the superior court of San Francisco, targeted Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips and Chevron.  It is the most significant lawsuit to put the spotlight on the fossil fuel industry and demand the creation of a fund to compensate for future damages caused by climate-related disasters.  It follows numerous other cases brought by US cities, counties and states against fossil fuel interests over the impact of climate change, as well as alleged disinformation campaigns spanning decades.  California's attorney general Rob Bonta, who is leading the case, claimed in the document the oil giants intentionally downplayed the risks posed by fossil fuels to the public since the 1950s – despite knowing their products were likely to lead to significant global warming.  ""Oil and gas company executives have known for decades that reliance on fossil fuels would cause these catastrophic results, but they suppressed that information from the public and policymakers by actively pushing out disinformation on the topic,"" read the 135-page complaint, as reported by the Times.  ""Their deception caused a delayed societal response to global warming. And their misconduct has resulted in tremendous costs to people, property, and natural resources, which continue to unfold each day."". 'Shameful'. Since the current wave of environmental litigation against fossil fuel firms began in 2017, the industry has sought to avoid state trials on procedural grounds.  That effort received a major blow in May when the US Supreme Court declined to consider an appeal in two cases, meaning they could proceed.  The legal complaint highlights the destruction unfolding in California from climate change, including record heat, wildfires and drought.

The Pope shook hands with Mongolian officials and Catholic leaders after arriving at the airport on Friday. His first event is set for Saturday.  So, we have new developments in the Spain Football scandal. The manager of the men's national team has apologized for applauding a defined speech made by Luis Rubiales last week. In it, the now suspended Spanish football chief said he would not resign and attacked what he called fake feminism. It was in reference to the ongoing backlash against his forcible kiss of Jennifer Hermoso at the head end of the Women's World Cup last month.  The Global Football Players Union has issued a statement in support of Hermoso saying, ""We have had enough."" Atika Shubert is in Madrid with more. It feels like the walls are closing in on Spanish football, you know, leaders and it's just fascinating to see the backlash and the response, frankly.  ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I mean, there's been national outrage over this. And so, the fallout is touching not just Rubiales but also those in the federation, but especially those men who applauded his defiant speech refusing to resign. However, it does seem that he survives another day. And that's because just a little less than two hours ago, the independent sports tribunal ruled that he would open investigation at the government's request to look -- to look at the be -- his behavior at the World Cup.  But only on the condition that these were -- these complaints such as the unwanted kiss and other complaints were, ""serious offenses."" Now, that's a very important legal distinction, because the government can only interfere in Spain with these kinds of sports disputes, if these offenses are considered very serious offenses or very grave offenses.

2,"UAE tackles food wastage for green, sustainable future. Redistribution of surplus food has helped cut wastage and conserve resources. Food waste is a pressing global issue with far-reaching environmental, economic, and social implications. Over a third of all food produced (2.5 billion tons) is lost or wasted each year. One third of this occurs in the food production stage.  Wastage happens at various stages of the supply chain, from production and transportation to retail and consumer levels. Such wastage has dire consequences for the planet, including the release of methane — a potent greenhouse gas — into the atmosphere, resource depletion, and biodiversity loss.  Economically, food waste represents a substantial loss, estimated at $940 billion, affecting businesses and consumers through increased food prices. Moreover, there are ethical concerns surrounding food wastage, given the coexistence of waste and hunger.  How UAE reduced food wastage. Recognising the severity of the problem, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has taken significant steps to address food wastage and contribute to a more sustainable future. One of the flagship initiatives in this endeavour is the UAE Food Bank, established in 2017. This innovative programme collects surplus food from hotels, restaurants and supermarkets and redistributes it to those in need. The UAE Food Bank has rapidly expanded its reach across the Emirates, simultaneously reducing food wastage and helping combat hunger.  Moreover, the ""Grace Conservation"" initiative, spearheaded by the Emirates Red Crescent Authority, is a groundbreaking programme. It not only addresses the needs of beneficiaries but also champions environmental conservation through resource recycling.  The project aims to instil a culture of generosity in society by reusing resources effectively. It reaches out to a diverse range of beneficiaries within and beyond the borders of the UAE. These beneficiaries include orphans' families, government and private sector employees, low-income households and families of prison inmates, among other segments. Through this initiative, surplus food is repurposed to serve those in need while fostering a sense of environmental responsibility and philanthropy among members of the society.  In addition to food redistribution efforts, the UAE has invested in sustainable agricultural practices such as hydroponics and vertical farming.",What initiatives has the UAE implemented to combat food wastage and promote sustainability?,"The UAE has implemented several initiatives to combat food wastage and promote sustainability.

2,"This distrust is the legacy of the World War II massacre of civilians, and torture and slavery in mines and factories, along with enduring disagreements over disputed territory.  ROK President Yoon Suk-yeol announced that his nation would use its own funds to compensate Koreans enslaved by Japanese companies. Polls show that a solid majority of people in the ROK oppose Yoon's handling of the forced labor issue and this reflects a wider unease about Japan's commitment to regional peace.  The motivations of Japan and the ROK in complying with the policy objectives of the Camp David summit sit atop a set of policy assumptions that inherently destabilize the Asia-Pacific region.  The Camp David summit was part of a plan to involve US-led allies in a more direct and coordinated attempt to contain China. Measures include physically threatening trade supply routes, using economic sanctions and weaponizing the US dollar. The US' security alliance with Australia and the United Kingdom, known as AUKUS; the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue; new military agreements with the Philippines; and the attempt to expand NATO are all in the China containment policy mix.  It is a policy initiative based on the assumption that China will somehow damage global trade by taking some unspecified action in the South China Sea. Just why China would ever choose to block its vital trade routes, or why any of its largest customers would block seaborne trade with China and so injure their own economies, is not explained. The illogical basis of the China threat is apparently beyond question by those who line up behind the US.  China has shown no inclination to develop a wide net of military bases in the region or the Global South, let alone close to the coast of the US. Chinese submarines do not probe US coastal waters or hold freedom of navigation exercises between Florida and Cuba. Nor has China entered into military agreements similar to those promoted by the US.  This means that Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members and the Global South would do better to adopt diplomatic and economic solutions led by China. Diplomatic solutions include support for an increased global role for BRICS through widening its membership to include more countries of the Global South. It includes active participation in trade agreements such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.","What are some policy initiatives and measures being taken by US-led allies to contain China, and what is the basis for the China threat assumption?","Some policy initiatives and measures being taken by US-led allies to contain China include the AUKUS security alliance with Australia and the United Kingdom, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, new military agreements with the Philippines, and attempts to expand NATO.

2,"""They want him out because they're scared of him,"" McNeese said. . Those interviewed said they believed that President Joe Biden's son Hunter was the one who needed to be charged and that Republicans faced a different standard under the justice system. And some said that perhaps Trump did commit crimes, but it didn't change their opinion of him because, as Texas resident Bobby Wilson put it, ""We all have sinned; we all have some things that we've done."" . ""He's probably guilty, but it doesn't matter,"" said Jace Kirschenman, an 18-year-old in South Dakota who works in construction.  He said nothing could deter him from voting for Trump next year. . ""You show me a perfect person in this world, and I'll show you a blue pig with wings,"" said Corey Shawgo, a 34-year-old truck driver in Pennsylvania who attended Trump's rally in Erie. ""Everyone makes mistakes."". Like many other Trump supporters interviewed, Scott Akers of Alabama immediately pointed to Hunter Biden when asked about Trump's mounting legal peril. . ""We have something finally start to come out about the connection between Hunter Biden's shady dealings and his father and then, like two days later, there's a federal indictment,"" Akers said. ""The timing of it is very ironic."". The president's son has been the subject of investigations by House Republicans and the federal Justice Department. The House GOP probe has so far failed to surface any evidence showing Joe Biden profited from his son's business dealings, but it has found that the younger Biden used his father's names to help advance deals. Separately, Hunter Biden was indicted on Thursday by special counsel David Weiss in connection to a gun he purchased in 2018.  'This country's a powder keg'. Intertwined with their outrage over the indictments, some Trump supporters are raising the specter of heightened political violence if Trump were to be convicted.  . ""This country's a powder keg. You know, we've 'bout had it,"" said Frank Yurisic, 76, who attended Trump's Pennsylvania rally. .","What reasons do some Trump supporters give for their belief that President Joe Biden's son Hunter should be charged, and how do they view Trump's legal situation in relation to their support for him?","Some Trump supporters believe that President Joe Biden's son Hunter should be charged due to their perception of his shady business dealings and connections to his father.

2,"For potential visitors the weather is too unpredictable in the summer. But travel trends do change, if slowly. In the 1950s the favourite holiday destination for Germans was a trip across the border to Austria. It was not before the mid-1980s that Spain took over. And experts agree that tourism in Europe in 30 years' time will be different from what it is today.  The industry has joined in with wider promises by businesses to hit the targets of the Paris climate agreement by becoming net-zero emitters of carbon dioxide by 2050. TUI, for instance, wants to be climate-neutral across its operations and supply chain by 2050. Yet such efforts by firms to mitigate the effects of global warming will have little overall impact. More importantly, tourism will need to adapt to climate change.  In the short term, this will be a question of measures such as strict management of water resources where these are becoming increasingly scarce, early-warning systems for extreme weather events and an extension of the holiday seasons, says Thomas Ellerbeck, chief sustainability officer at tui. His company is, for instance, extending the booking season for Greece until November. Mr Kirstges thinks many more hotels in the Med will install air conditioning (fuelled by solar power), water coolers and the like. Tourists may adapt by going out in the mornings and evenings to avoid the midday furnace.  Longer term, some switching from the golden sands of the Med to the beaches of the Baltic is inevitable. But there is a silver lining for the holidaymakers who will either discover the unexpected beauty of Baltic beaches or may go south at different times of the year. A shift by some tourists to the spring or autumn will help with the overcrowding which has become a such a nuisance for residents and those visitors eager to imbibe the culture of Dubrovnik, Venice, Barcelona or other marvels of southern Europe in relative peace. ■.

2,"He has been held in Moscow's Lefortovo pre-trial detention center, notorious for its harsh conditions, ever since. Last month, a court in Moscow extended his detention until the end of November.  Russia's Federal Security Service said Gershkovich, ""acting on the instructions of the American side, collected information constituting a state secret about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex."". The authorities haven't detailed what — if any — evidence they have gathered to support the espionage charges, which both Gershkovich and WSJ deny.

Tracy, the U.S. ambassador, visited Gershkovich in prison several times since his arrest, most recently in August. Following her visit on Friday, the U.S. embassy said on X, the platform previously known as Twitter, that Gershkovich ""remains strong and is keeping up with the news -including his parents' appearance at the UN this week,"" and reiterated the call to release him and another American imprisoned in Russia on espionage charges, Paul Whelan.

The site includes a synagogue as well as Orthodox, Armenian and Catholic religious buildings, reflecting the city's diversity.  ""In its urban fabric and its architecture, Lviv is an outstanding example of the fusion of the architectural and artistic traditions of Eastern Europe with those of Italy and Germany,"" UNESCO said.

So, all these cases are going to have to be separated and each case has to be tried on its own merits. We call that a severance.  COATES: Well, Jon Sale, on that, I was hoping for a second on this because I've always thought that by virtue of that advice of counsel defense, it sets up quite the acrimonious, contentious relationship, right? Because the privilege normally would exist. The crime fraud exception would suggest that if you're engaged in a crime together, you don't get that same privilege.  But even if you set that aside for a second, are you suggesting that by virtue of being a co-defendant, that Donald Trump would be in a better position to say he cannot mount a viable defense because his attorneys wouldn't even have the opportunity to say whether, you know, they acted in this way, they couldn't testify in the same way because that privilege does belong to the client?. SALE: That's right. But in order to confirm or corroborate or whether or not they gave him advice, whether he disclosed everything to them, whether he relied on that advice, he certainly would want to call the lawyers to say, here was the advice they gave me. And he doesn't have the ability to call them, not through any fault of his own, but because they're all joined together.  So, this case is going to be fraught with litigation. Even though it's pardon proof, the Atlanta, Georgia case, when you have 19 defendants -- I mean, there's a RICO case going on right now in Atlanta, brought by the same district attorney, and I can't imagine how this is happening.  But it has been taking them six months to pick a jury. So, I just don't see how this case can go to trial.","Why would calling the co-defendants to testify be problematic for Donald Trump's defense, and what complications could arise in the case due to the large number of defendants?","Calling the co-defendants to testify would be problematic for Donald Trump's defense because they would likely invoke their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. This means that they would refuse to testify, which would prevent Trump from confirming or corroborating their advice, disclosures, and reliance in his defense. Additionally, the large number of defendants in the case could lead to complications and prolong the litigation process, as seen in a similar RICO case in Atlanta where it took six months to select a jury.",e70fe49f969fe2226bce07f58132ace7

2,"One factor that has particularly concerned scientists is the record low Antarctic sea ice extent - the lowest negative anomaly for August since satellite observations began in the late 1970s.  The loss of sea ice coverage is concerning because it helps to reflect heat. Without ice cover, more heat is absorbed by the oceans, speeding up the rate at which they warm. As temperatures warm in the poles, winter conditions can change in nearby regions, causing more extreme weather events.  "". It comes after back-to-back low sea-ice coverage, which has resulted in almost no emperor penguin chicks surviving in parts of Antarctica during the summer of 2022.

You should not put vegetation near or on your home because it ""poses additional risk,"" she warned. . Instead, remove anything that could catch fire (like mulch, plants and leaves) from within 1.5 metres of the house and keep the lawn mowed so it's shorter than 10 centimetres. Keeping other trees pruned so there's about two metres of empty space between the ground and the first branches and trimming them back as needed is another easy place to start. . Households can reduce wildfire risk further by removing conifer trees that are within 10 metres of the house. . ""A lot of it is about choosing fire-resistant plants or keeping things short and trimmed back from the house and kind of spacing between trees and things like that,"" said Eyquem. . In order for individuals to choose the right approach for their home, they first need to know what risks they are actually facing, she added. .

HOLMES: I think there are multiple things going on inside of his head. I think we know that this makes him angry. We know that he is frustrated. We know that this is not what he wants to be doing. He wants us all to go away. He wants to be talking about 2024. He wants to be president again. That is what he wants to be focusing on.  And it's clear through these posts that he is angry.

When you look at some of the posts, and I don't think we need to get into all of them, they're not all just about this case, they're also -- you talk Nancy Pelosi and her family with outrageous claims. That is exactly what we saw in 2016. It becomes more and more escalated. The more and more he feels like he's getting coverage on it. And so that is what he is trying to do right now.  I also will tell you that I know from people who are close to him from his advisers that he's riled up, that he was essentially chomping on the bit before heading down to court on Thursday.

But, when David Ignatius, the Columnist for The Washington Post, who has been close to this President for many, many years, for many decades, actually, when he makes this type of blunt argument in the pages of The Washington Post, that certainly has taken a lot of people by surprise and taking notice of this. The question is, is he trying to send a message, or who is he trying to send a message through to, uh, to get to the President? He was very blunt in this, and he is not really coming from it from a critical way as much as from a way of admiration.  He said he has been a very successful President. He said it pains me to write this, but he launches an argument on a couple of fronts, once the age of the President, and as well, the Vice President. He says, they believe that she simply is not going to help the ticket here. And he was explaining earlier this morning in another interview why he did this. And he said, he is saying this now, because he believes there should be at least a conversation about this. This is something that the Democratic Party does not want to talk about. Democratic Senators do not want to talk about the President's age. White House advisors don't want to do that. So, this is why David Ignatius says he is injecting into the bloodstream, if you will, to get this conversation going. But it's very blunt.

2,"But look, I think there's an enormous geostrategic opportunity for the US and the G-7 to step up while China is stepping back in terms of this lending. The IMF has said that a majority of low-income countries are either in debt distress or at high risk of falling into debt distress. We know from studies of Belt and Road contracts that China's lending often includes highly non-standard provisions that have allowed China to take very aggressive action to get repaid or to exert very unusual amounts of influence on the debtor, like collateral pledges that have nothing to do with the infrastructure project itself and give China access to ports or commodities and non-disclosure provisions that keep the borrower's citizens in the dark.  On top of all of that, we know that right now when countries have an almost unprecedented need for external financing, Chinese net lending to the developing world is falling sharply. And where they're still lending, the average borrowing cost for distressed countries is considerably higher than for rescue loans extended by the IMF. So, there's a real opportunity for us to step up right now where China has essentially engaged in deals that are not in the interest of the borrowing country. And again, that's going to require, that's going to require Congress to give us the financial firepower to step up. It's going to require coordination with other G-7 countries so that the sum is greater than the individual parts.  And it's going to require creativity because there may be tools that we need to create or at least enhance so that we don't just go to countries in Latin America and Asia and sub-Saharan Africa and give speeches, but we say, look, we want to compete and we want to compete on economically attractive terms to what you've been offered by China. And we're not going to force them to choose. We shouldn't force them to choose. We should just ask them to give us a chance. And I think we're in an era in which economic real politic is necessary. We have to have an unsentimental look at where our interests align with those of non-geopolitically aligned countries.

Loomer has a history of derogatory and provocative remarks - particularly against Muslims - that has led to her being banned from social media platforms and being ostracized by other Republicans. Loomer has denied being a white supremacist or anti-Muslim, describing herself as a ""free speech absolutist."" She has publicly feuded with Rep.

2,"Five Key Things to Watch for in Republican Primary Debate. A candidate's performance in a presidential debate can make or break a campaign.  Florida Senator Marco Rubio's dressing down at the hands of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie represented the death knell for a once-promising White House bid in 2016. Former Hollywood actor Ronald Reagan's commanding performances at the microphone over the course of the 1980 presidential campaign arguably won him the Republican nomination and, later, the presidency. And in a 1992 debate against Democratic challenger Bill Clinton, then-President George H.W. Bush's decision to check his watch during an audience question about the economy helped cement an image of him as out-of-touch with the concerns of working Americans, rushing him along to a crushing debate in November.  The Republican field of candidates this cycle will inherit an unprecedented and arguably insurmountable challenge as they seek to defeat a two-time nominee in their party, former President Donald Trump, who holds a commanding lead in most national polls. They will also have to do so as the man they seek to beat isn't on the same stage—Trump has already announced he will not participate in any debates this presidential cycle, much to the chagrin of party leadership. But in a race for second place, there is a lot for the prospective candidates to gain, particularly given a front-runner whose campaign war chest is committed to fighting off 91 criminal charges in four different jurisdictions.  Here's what to look for Wednesday night:. DeSantis vs. Ramaswamy. . Since his dominating win in his 2022 reelection bid for governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis has been considered the man to beat in a crowded GOP field to replace Trump, once polling nearly neck-and-neck with a man many Republicans consider the face of the modern GOP.  That narrative changed quickly. In several recent polls, DeSantis—once a real contender to unseat Trump at the top of the Republican pecking order—has been struggling to hold his grip on second-place as upstarts like Vivek Ramaswamy and even ""Never Trump"" candidate Christie have seen a surge in polling among the half of the Republican electorate willing to back someone other than Trump.","What challenges do the Republican candidates face as they seek to defeat former President Donald Trump, and how has Ron DeSantis's position in the polls changed in relation to Vivek Ramaswamy and ""Never Trump"" candidate Christie?","The Republican candidates face the challenges of defeating former President Donald Trump, who holds a commanding lead in most national polls, and doing so without the opportunity to directly compete against him in debates, as Trump has announced that he will not participate. The excerpt mentions that Ron DeSantis, once considered a strong contender in the race for second place, has been struggling to maintain his position. Recent polls show DeSantis facing competition from upstarts like Vivek Ramaswamy and even ""Never Trump"" candidate Christie, who have seen a surge in polling among Republicans who are willing to support someone other than Trump.",515d077ce1b9f38cece37d663b597813

It makes India look like an appendix to somebody else and that certainly is not acceptable. India has enormous potential in its own right and that is why the plus one is the wrong term in my view."". Hans-Paul Burkner, Global Chair Emeritus, BCG, says unlike Europe, ""in India, there is enormous energy, enormous ambition and people really have high expectations but they are also working very hard for it. It does not come by itself. And many of these companies, which maybe even 10 years ago, nobody has heard of, will play a very big role in the coming years, not just in India but across the world."". Burkner further says: ""We at BCG see India's growth at 7-8% as absolutely doable. We have to be, of course, realistic about what is happening in the rest of the world. Europe will be at 1-2% GDP growth. On an average, the US probably will grow around 3%, China could be around 5%.

Today, we, the three leaders, held the very first standalone trilateral Summit marking a new chapter in our trilateral cooperation. Today, we have agreed on the Camp David principles that will function as the enduring guidelines for our trilateral cooperation. In addition, we have developed the Spirit of Camp David, which is a document embodying the vision of our trilateral cooperation and ways to translate our will to cooperate into action.  First of all, to facilitate the stable development of our trilateral cooperation, we have built the institutional basis for the trilateral cooperation at multiple levels and sectors.  In addition to making our trilateral summit regular, we have agreed to have our governments' personnel at all levels -- including foreign ministers, defense ministers, and national security advisors -- meet every year to closely coordinate our trilateral cooperation.  In particular, we, the three leaders, have agreed to establish a communication channel so we can swiftly coordinate and respond together in case an urgent issue occurs in the region.  Furthermore, to bolster our trilateral strategic cooperation in the Indo- Pacific, our three countries will establish the ROK, US, Japan Indo-Pacific dialogue, which will discover new areas of cooperation.

Franklin Roosevelt used the Yalta Conference to put an end to World War Two. Ronald Reagan used his meeting with Gorbachev in Geneva to mark the beginning of the end of the Cold War.

The UN International Organization for Migration has pointed to estimates there will be as many as a billion environmental migrants in the next 30 years and that number could rise even higher by 2060. Well, the routes those migrants may be taking are already extremely dangerous.

2,"US 'university' spreads climate lies and receives millions from rightwing donors. PragerU is not accredited but has become a key tool in pushing false claims to youngsters – and raked in $200m from 2018 to 2022. A rightwing media outlet promoting climate-change denialism and other ""anti-woke"" staples to young students and adults via social media has become a fundraising Goliath, raking in close to $200m from 2018 to 2022 with big checks from top conservative donors, tax records reveal.  Founded in 2009 by the conservative talkshow host Dennis Prager, the eponymous Prager University Foundation is not an accredited education organization. But via online media its PragerU Kids division has become a key tool in spreading false claims to young people with short videos aimed at undercutting widely accepted science that climate crisis disasters are accelerating due, largely, to fossil-fuel usage.  PragerU's influence in pushing false narratives about climate change and other far-right shibboleths such as airbrushing the brutal reality of American slavery gained ground when the Florida board of education in July gave the green light to using its videos and other materials in classrooms, a move that PragerU is trying to capitalize on in Texas and other states. On Tuesday, Oklahoma's school system also approved the use of PragerU's materials.  But some of PragerU's expansion plans ran into trouble in August, when it was condemned by Texas education officials for announcing prematurely that Texas schools had approved the usage of its advocacy materials, generating new scrutiny and criticism of PragerU's operations.  Prager's website trumpets its mission and its niche in the conservative ecosystem.  ""PragerU is the world's leading conservative non-profit, focused on changing minds through the creative use of digital media."". That sweeping mission has been fueled by big conservative money and slick marketing, and has led to PragerU's rising influence on the right.

Already today, more than 2 percent of all shipments have already transition to green shipping.  But it is a long way to go until we have them all on board. And it will not happen only by taking bold moves such as ordering Laura Maersk. We need to continue to work on having the proper financial incentives for a lot of these companies to do the right thing. And that what this essentially means is a carbon tax.  CHATTERLEY: Yes, I was about to say, what does that actually mean in practice, because you obviously, as you mentioned, have 750 vessels? How long is it going to take to get all of those from dark to green effectively? And to your point, arguably, it puts you at a relative disadvantage in the short term, at least with these investment competitors that aren't moving.  The hope is that the incentive in structure can change. And that's government led in order to facilitate that move quicker. What do you need?. CLERC: Yes, so for us, it has to take 17 years if we have to make it by 2040, obviously, but we're quite optimistic actually, because the maritime sector is governed by the International Maritime Organization. It's a U.N. compact where all countries are represented.","What percentage of shipments have already transitioned to green shipping, and how long will it take for all 750 vessels to make the transition?","According to the excerpt, more than 2 percent of all shipments have already transitioned to green shipping.

2,"After the celebration: How Moonshot clears the way for the big & the bold. While geopolitical rivalry is a reality, Delhi must work to limit competition and expand cooperation in outer space.  Written by C. Raja Mohan. Oslo | Updated: August 23, 2023 19:15 IST. Listen to this article x. THAT India is only the fourth country to soft land on the Moon and the first to touch down near the lunar south pole is a moment of great national celebration. This is also a moment to seize the new possibilities for India's leadership in transforming the relationship between humanity and outer space.  Indeed, the one lunar day (two Earth weeks) that the Chandrayaan-3 rover will spend probing the southern polar region of the Moon heralds a new era in India's engagement with space.  India's successful moonshot comes when the major powers are moving away from treating space ventures as mere ""prestige"" projects to fly the flag. They want to gain a big share of the unfolding space industrialisation, extract extra-terrestrial mineral resources, and embark on deep space exploration. They also want to gain a military advantage in space over their geopolitical rivals on Earth.  The Moon has become a critical waystation for human's future activity in space – a place to establish a self-sustaining presence and head from there to other parts of the cosmos. The race to the Moon's south pole is based on the expectation that there will be water and other vital ingredients to support human activity.  Realising India's full potential in the space domain demands an overhaul of Delhi's strategy. Five imperatives stand out.  First, as former ISRO chairman K. Sivan put it, the time has come for India to look beyond ""frugal engineering"" and think big. The Indian space programme gets many compliments for getting such a big bang for its limited budget. But frugal innovation is no longer enough for India to make a difference to global activity on the Moon.  While Chandrayaan took nearly six weeks to get to the Moon, the failed Russian mission Luna-25 arrived there in a week.",What are the reasons behind major powers' interest in space ventures and exploration?,"Major powers are interested in space ventures and exploration for several reasons.

3,"How scientists are modelling an 'alternative universe' to understand climate change's impact on extreme weather. ""Is climate change to blame?"" It's a question that often gets asked after extreme weather events. . It's only natural that people want to understand just what role climate change has played in extreme heatwaves, bushfires and floods being experienced around the world.  Advances in something called attribution science have allowed researchers to study the links between extreme weather and climate change. . It's something the Bureau of Meteorology is also investing in, alongside forecasts and observations, climate attribution statements are in the pipeline. . So how does it work and why does it matter? . What is attribution science? . Climate scientists emphasise that asking, ""is climate change to blame?"", is almost impossible to answer, because it's already influencing everything.  Loading Twitter content. Instead, extreme weather attribution studies try to figure out if climate change made a certain weather event more (or less) likely and/or intense. As well as measuring the role of other influences, such as a La Niña or El Niño. . It's essentially modelling a counterfactual world — or a parallel universe — where industrialisation and the large-scale burning of fossil fuels didn't happen, to work out what could have been.  . There are two main kinds of attribution science, weather trends, like the warmest Australian winter on record and specific extreme events, like the Black Summer bushfires as well as the relatively new field of impact attribution. . Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist from the University of New South Wales, is one of the few people in Australia leading the charge on attribution science. . Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick says Australia has an opportunity to be a leader in extreme weather attribution.(Supplied: Sarah Perkins). ""Event attribution has been around for a couple of decades, along with trend attribution,"" she said. .",What is the purpose of attribution science and what does it aim to determine?,"The purpose of attribution science is to study the links between extreme weather events and climate change.

3,"I mean, it's nearly 250 years old. It's a company everyone knows."". Still, while Kenvue was the biggest deal of the year, it's barely holding onto its IPO price today, according to CNBC and Renaissance Capital data, and the IPO market overall hasn't performed great after listing. Sixty-four percent — or 45 out of 70 IPOs year-to-date — are trading below their IPO price. Most of those deals have been at the smaller end of the market caps, and even the tech sector, hit hardest in the IPO freeze, is now pushing ahead, with chip giant Arm and grocery startup Instacart planning to go public this week and next.  Retail stocks have underperformed this year. ""Birkenstock is in a class of its own,"" said Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. ""It's a long-standing brand, it's been around for a very long time. It's very well known, it has a niche customer who appreciates its brand equity, its shape, and finish and styling and comfort."" . But Cohen says investors shouldn't bank on its success as a new publicly traded stock. . Covid-19 brought significant and abrupt change to the retail industry, but many of those changes have been upended again as the pandemic wanes. The course of inflation, meanwhile, will continue to influence consumer spending in the near-term. Most consumers have had no experience as adults dealing with inflation, Cohen said. ""We're dealing with a very odd series of events that continue coming out of Covid,"" he added.  Add to the list of risks the rise of knockoff Birkenstock products on Facebook, which the company pointed to in its IPO filing.  While inflation has come down from its peak, there are signs that it will persist, and consumers tend to cut back on discretionary spending in this kind of environment. Credit concerns have also hit a level not seen since 2009. Even as Wall Street firms lower the odds of a recession hitting, it's still a risk with significant consumer implications, though maybe not a risk that will hit soon enough to dent current IPO enthusiasm.",What factors have contributed to the underperformance of IPOs in the market?,"One factor contributing to the underperformance of IPOs in the market is that the majority of IPOs are trading below their IPO price, with 64% of IPOs this year trading below their initial price. Additionally, the retail sector has underperformed this year, and the course of inflation and credit concerns have also had an impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant and abrupt changes to the retail industry, and as the pandemic wanes, there are uncertainties about the future of consumer spending. Furthermore, the rise of knockoff products, such as knockoff Birkenstock products on Facebook, has also been a concern for companies going public.",48cbf8efa57303aec9c43069596df8f3
3,"The message from Camp David to China and North Korea: Stop dangerous and aggressive activities. Notwithstanding contentious differences between the Republic of Korea (ROK) and Japan, the recent trilateral summit of three countries-the US, Japan, and ROK, certainly indicates the growing ties between the three nations, propelled by emerging security challenges. The joint statement rightly observes that the world is at 'a hinge point of history' because of geopolitical competition, the climate crisis, the prolonging Russia-Ukraine conflict, and nuclear provocations. . The summit is important for four reasons. First, it institutionalised cooperation among the three countries. They committed to organise such meetings annually. While Biden underscored that the world would be safer if the three countries stood together, Kishida averred to take coordination between the three countries to new heights, and Yoon stressed that challenges that threaten regional security demand a stronger commitment to working together. The joint statement mentioned that with the renewed bonds of friendship, girded by the ironclad U.S.-Japan and U.S.-ROK alliances, both bilateral and trilateral relationships are now stronger. They have decided to hold trilateral meetings of their leaders, foreign ministers, defence ministers, and national security advisors regularly.          . Second, despite the refusal by four petitioners out of a total eighteen from the ROK for compensation for forced labour during the World War II, Yoon decided to move ahead with his policy of developing closer relations with Japan. While there is still a sizable population in the ROK opposing closer ties with Japan, Yoon's step also suggests that there is a segment of population, that sees the urgency for cooperation in view of increasing threats from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and China.  He changed the policy of his predecessor, who was reported to have given assurances to China after receiving a warning from that country, that the ROK would not deploy additional Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries, participate in a regional U.S.-led missile defence system, or join a trilateral alliance with the US.","What are the four reasons why the trilateral summit between the US, Japan, and South Korea is important?","The trilateral summit between the US, Japan, and South Korea is important for four reasons. First, it institutionalizes cooperation among the three countries, with commitments to hold annual meetings and strengthen coordination. This is evident in the joint statement, which highlights the importance of standing together to address emerging security challenges. Second, the summit signifies a shift in South Korea's policy towards Japan, despite opposition from some segments of the population. This suggests an understanding of the need for cooperation in the face of threats from North Korea and China. Third, the renewed bonds of friendship and stronger alliances between the countries lead to stronger bilateral and trilateral relationships. Regular meetings of leaders, ministers, and advisors are planned to deepen this cooperation. Lastly, the summit acknowledges the geopolitical competition, climate crisis, Russia-Ukraine conflict, and nuclear provocations as global challenges at a pivotal moment in history.",e1bd425e11c16df0637c1d46d1960fb8

Now, we've heard from officials here, including the Sheriff Patrick Labat of Fulton County, that Trump and his co-defendants are going to be treated the same as everybody else. So let me walk you through what the normal booking process would look like here at the jail for a newly charged defendant. And that process would involve hours of waiting, simply waiting for their turn to get fingerprinted, and get their mug shots taken. Also, there is typically a body search that is conducted by a jail deputy.  Although in the past high-profile defendants who have voluntarily surrendered have been able to forego that body search.

3,"'Climate change to blame'. Experts have blamed climate change for the ""once-in-500-year"" rainstorm that pummelled the city, warning of more extreme weather events that will be difficult to forecast while calling for better disaster prevention.  ""This would have been virtually impossible had it not been for climate change,"" Lam Chiu-ying, a former director of the Observatory, said yesterday. ""We have to be prepared for what used to be extreme but what could become normal.""  The Observatory recorded the highest hourly rainfall since records began in 1884 between 11pm and midnight on Thursday, at 158.1mm. More than 600mm of rain was recorded overall, amounting to a quarter of the city's total annual level, it said.  The black rainstorm warning was in force for more than 16 hours after being raised at 11.05pm on Thursday.   Chief Secretary Eric Chan Kwok-ki said yesterday the storm was a ""once-in-500-years"" event when he provided details on efforts to tackle the aftermath.  Hong Kong Meteorological Society spokesman Leung Wing-mo, a former assistant director at the Observatory, said the probability could be calculated using past rainstorms.  ""There is a statistical method, which, based on the frequency and intensity of the rainstorms over the past years, can reach a so-called distribution, and it can be seen that 158.1mm of rainfall in an hour or 500mm in 24 hours may only occur once in hundreds of years or 500 years,"" he said.   More frequent and stronger storms were to be expected because of global warming, he warned.  The torrential rain brought the city to a standstill, with cars left stranded on flooded roads overnight, some railway stations submerged, and many shops forced to close because of the damage.  Addressing mounting public criticism over a perceived lack of preparedness, Chan said the predictability of rainstorms was ""very low"" compared with forecasts for typhoons, and the latest one was too big and sudden for authorities to issue warnings early.  Meteorologists said the characteristics of rainstorms, which often formed nearby and within a short period of time, made it impossible to forecast them days ahead.",What factors have experts cited as the cause of the intense rainstorm in Hong Kong and what are the implications for future weather events?,"Experts have cited climate change as the cause of the intense rainstorm in Hong Kong. They warn that more extreme weather events, like this rainstorm, will be difficult to forecast in the future. This is because climate change is leading to more frequent and stronger storms. The former director of the Observatory, Lam Chiu-ying, stated that the rainstorm would have been virtually impossible without climate change. The Hong Kong Meteorological Society spokesman, Leung Wing-mo, explained that based on past rainstorms, the probability of such intense rainfall occurring is only once in hundreds of years or 500 years. This highlights the need for better disaster prevention and preparation for what used to be extreme but may become more common due to climate change.",61ddf26812583a6b87fecd2304823faa

3,"Orange County, San Diego County, those people don't know anything about hurricanes or tropical storms. How much does that exacerbate or increase the risk of the danger of what's coming.  JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: A lot. I am from this area and I can't say I have ever heard of a hurricane from Los Angeles. So, let me -- the challenge, as you note, is actually twofold.  So, one is that the population is just simply not acclimated to this kind of rain, this kind of wind, and the kind of hurricanes that you would see in Atlanta or in the gulf coast. Populations can get used to climate disasters in the sense that they know what to do and they have provisions and they know how to listen to emergency managers, and they know what an evacuation is like. You simply don't have that in Los Angeles or the surrounding areas.  The second challenge with these climate disasters that are, you know, so new is emergency responders cannot measure, have no history for what the impact will be. And so they were just, as we were reporting, prepositioning a lot of materials and assets that will help when the destruction comes, but because these are all such a historical events that we have no history, so to speak, to figure out okay, these areas are more likely to be damaged and these are not.  So, it is -- as, you know, these climate disasters are common now, but they are so unique that we just cannot measure impact very well.  BLACKWELL: You make a good point. It's not just the population, but those who will have to respond. You know, there are places that I travel as a correspondent, the Carolinas to Florida, you call the same people season after season, and you know where they will be, they know what to do.",What are the challenges faced by populations in areas like Los Angeles that are not accustomed to hurricanes and how does it impact emergency response efforts?,"The challenges faced by populations in areas like Los Angeles, who are not accustomed to hurricanes, are twofold. Firstly, the population is not acclimated to the intense rain, strong winds, and overall impact of hurricanes. This means that they may not be familiar with what to do in such situations, including evacuation procedures and listening to emergency managers. Secondly, emergency responders also face challenges because there is no historical data or experience to determine the likely impact of the hurricane on specific areas. This makes it difficult to measure the potential damage or allocate resources effectively. As mentioned in the excerpt, emergency responders in these areas are prepositioning materials and assets, but the lack of historical data makes it challenging to accurately anticipate the impact. Overall, the unfamiliarity of the population and the lack of historical data make it challenging for both the affected population and emergency responders to effectively respond to hurricanes in areas like Los Angeles.",a209ceb31d1e1fa906ca3435407e9cc4

Mocking Ramaswamy's inexperience, Pence said: ""Now is not the time for on-the-job training. We don't need to bring in a rookie."". Several other presidential candidates – including the rightwing commentator Larry Elder, the former Texas congressman Will Hurd and the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez – failed to meet the Republican National Committee's qualifications for the debate, leaving them out of the event and further diminishing their primary prospects. Hurd elected to live-tweet his reactions to the debate, and he criticised his opponents who said they would still support Trump in the event of a conviction.  ""Anyone who raises their hand in support of Donald Trump as our party's nominee even if convicted in a court of law is unfit to serve as president,"" Hurd said.  But Trump's criminal charges appear to have only fortified his position as the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary. According to the CBS poll, 73 per cent of Trump's voters say they back the former president partly to ""show support for his legal troubles"".  With such stalwart support for Trump among the Republican base, it remains unclear how any of the participants in the Monday debate could capture the nomination. The electoral threat of nominating a twice-impeached former president, who now faces nearly 100 criminal charges, did not escape the attention of at least one debate participant.

3,"The plea. Petitioner-advocate Harsh Vibhore Singhal pleaded with a bench headed by CJI D Y Chandrachud that many boys, who were just over 18 years of age, were stigmatised on being arrested for indulging in consensual sex with girls in the 16-18 age group. ""This grey area of law, a legislative vacuum, needs to be filled by guidelines on how statutory rape laws would operate by assessment of consent of 16+ to 18-year-olds before indicting the consenting adults,"" he said. The petitioner quoted a study conducted for the health ministry, according to which 10% of women in the age group of 25-49 years had their first sexual intercourse before the age of 15, and 39% had before the age of 18 years. A relief. RBI has issued comprehensive guidelines regarding penal charges in loan accounts in an effort to promote fairness, transparency, and accountability in the lending practices of financial institutions. The banks and other lending institutions including NBFCs have been barred from levying penal rate of interest on loans in cases of default or non-compliance.  The new rule takes effect from January 1, 2024, the RBI said in its notification on 'Fair Lending Practice-Penal Charges in Loan Accounts'. RBI says. The quantum of penal charges ""shall be reasonable and commensurate with the noncompliance"" of material terms and conditions of loan contract without being discriminatory within a particular loan/product category. Penal interest vs penal charges. Banks can impose penal charges. RBI says penalty, if charged, for non-compliance of material terms and conditions of loan contract by the borrower shall be treated as 'penal charges'.  But the same shall not be levied in the form of 'penal interest' that is added to the rate of interest charged on the advances. Also, there won't be any capitalisation of penal charges — no further interest computed on such charges. Why this move?. The intent of levying penal interest or charges is essentially to inculcate a sense of credit discipline.",What is the purpose of the comprehensive guidelines issued by the RBI regarding penal charges in loan accounts?,"The purpose of the comprehensive guidelines issued by the RBI regarding penal charges in loan accounts is to promote fairness, transparency, and accountability in lending practices of financial institutions.

3,"""The government has not said whether it will compensate us. I run two shops but what I can I do?"". A few weeks ago, cars were still slowly pushing through lingering floodwaters and mush in the main street. On either side of the road were mud-caked vehicles, with windscreens smashed in as they were submerged when the water suddenly rose with such force.  A brown line revealed what was the high-water mark, with all manner of first-floor items swallowed up and spat out into the street as the flood spread the carnage.  ""We suffered big losses: trucks and other vehicles; our goods; furniture; everything we own was wrecked,"" says Mrs Han, who operates a warehouse for deliveries with her husband.  He indicates how even the goods stored high on racks well above three metres were ruined.  Then his wife opens the door to their nearby home - a thick layer of mud cakes everything.

Climate scientists are the first to acknowledge that you can't view any extreme weather experience in isolation.  In June, northern China was baking, with week after week of temperatures soaring above 40C (104F), and then a month's worth of rain bucketed down in 24 hours.  ""These weather events do happen without climate change,"" says Prof Cascade Tuholske. ""The mechanisms driving individual events, or compound events like heatwaves and floods impacting China this summer are complex, but climate change is making extreme events more common and more intense."". The professor, a geographer at Montana State University, adds that ""climate change-driven weather extremes are a huge problem for China because of its dense population and as a major global economy"".  He also says that ""every tonne of CO2 that remains in the ground, means fewer people in China will be harmed in the future"".  Whether because of droughts or sudden floods, extreme weather is again drawing attention to the impact of climate change on China, with serious questions being asked about whether or not the measures in place to fight it are currently ambitious enough to rein in the destructive force of these potentially catastrophic events.",What are the potential consequences of climate change-driven extreme weather events in China?,"The potential consequences of climate change-driven extreme weather events in China include significant damage to infrastructure and property, loss of livelihoods, and harm to the population.

In recent years, injury data has quite clearly indicated that NFL players are more likely to suffer a serious injury on artificial turf compared to natural grass playing surfaces, yet NFL teams across the league refuse to move away from artificial turf. And there's one big reason why – concerts and events like the recent Taylor Swift Eras Tour that sold out NFL venues across the country.  In his first major public comments since he was named to the position, NFL Players Association executive director Lloyd Howell called on the NFL to install natural grass playing surfaces in all stadiums across the league, saying ""players overwhelmingly prefer it and the data is clear that grass is simply safer than artificial turf."". But league insider Mike Florio doesn't see that happening, because then it would keep teams from hosting events like the Eras Tour, which are financially lucrative to the teams.  ""He's absolutely right. But the NFL won't do it,"" Florio wrote of Howell's comments. ""Apart from the cost of installing and maintaining grass, owners with stadiums that host many other events will not want to devise a system for removing the grass for, for example, a Taylor Swift concert."".

3,"The global economy's real enemy is geopolitics, not protectionism. ""The era of free trade seems to be over. How will the world economy fare under protectionism?"". This is one of the most common questions I hear nowadays. But the distinction between free trade and protectionism (like the one between markets and the state, or mercantilism and liberalism) is not especially helpful for understanding the global economy. Not only does it misrepresent recent history; but it also misconstrues today's policy transitions and the conditions needed for a healthy global economy.  ""Free trade"" conjures an image of governments stepping back to allow markets to determine economic outcomes on their own. But any market economy requires rules and regulations – product standards; controls on anticompetitive business conduct; consumer, labour, and environmental safeguards; lender-of-last-resort and financial-stability functions – which are typically promulgated and enforced by governments.  Moreover, when national jurisdictions are linked up through international trade and finance, additional questions arise: Which countries' rules and regulations should take precedence when businesses compete in global markets? Should the rules be designed anew through international treaties and regional or global organisations?. Viewed in this light, it becomes clear that hyper-globalisation – which lasted roughly from the early 1990s until the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic – was not a period of free trade in the traditional sense. The trade agreements signed over the past 30 years were not so much about removing cross-border restrictions on trade and investment as they were about regulatory standards, health and safety rules, investment, banking and finance, intellectual property (IP), labour, the environment, and many other issues that previously lay in the domain of domestic policy.  Nor were these rules neutral. They tended to prioritise the interests of politically connected big businesses, such as international banks, pharmaceutical companies, and multinational corporations, over all else. These businesses not only got better access to markets globally; they also were the primary beneficiaries of special international arbitration procedures to reverse government regulations that reduced their profits.  Similarly, tighter IP rules – which allow pharmaceutical and tech companies to abuse their monopoly positions – were smuggled in under the guise of freer trade.","What is the difference between ""free trade"" and ""hyper-globalization"" in terms of their impact on the global economy and regulatory standards?","The difference between ""free trade"" and ""hyper-globalization"" lies in their impact on the global economy and regulatory standards. ""Free trade"" typically refers to the idea of governments stepping back and allowing markets to determine economic outcomes. However, any market economy requires rules and regulations set by governments, such as product standards, anticompetitive business controls, and consumer/labor/environmental safeguards. On the other hand, ""hyper-globalization,"" which lasted from the early 1990s to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, focused more on regulatory standards, health and safety rules, investment, banking and finance, intellectual property, and other issues previously within the domain of domestic policy.

3,"""We are seeing a lot more cases popping up,"" she said. It is a trend organised crime groups in Brazil and Central America are also tapping into, according to a report published in the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs in March. The MS-13 criminal gang that operates in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala has been using bitcoin as a way for victims to hand over extortion payments and as payment for transporting cocaine to Mexico, the report found. It said organised crime groups are ""discovering growing cracks in the regional anti-money laundering architecture that make the switch to cryptocurrencies increasingly attractive."" The report's co-author Douglas Farah said using cryptocurrency for laundering drug money was easier in countries with lax crypto regulation or where bitcoin is classified as a legal tender, such as El Salvador. ""Dollars can come in and out of bitcoin with no traceability ... there's zero control on bitcoin transactions, but there's no monitoring, no attempt to do anything about it,"" said Farah, who heads IBI Consultants, a US-based security consulting firm, in reference to El Salvador. To move money through cryptocurrency platforms, criminals are taking advantage of unregulated exchanges that do not require proof of identification or registration information, said crypto intelligence company CipherTrace. In Mexico, to stop transactions being detected by authorities — who require registered cryptocurrency trading platforms to report transfers above Mex$56,000 ($3,300) — criminals buy and launder small amounts of bitcoin, found a 2021 report by the International Narcotics Control Board. Criminals operating in Latin America also hire the services of ""tumblers"" who, in exchange for a commission, mix identifiable crypto with illegal funds to make them harder to trace, according to CipherTrace. Yet most countries in the region have not updated their anti-money laundering regulations to include cryptocurrencies, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Countries with few or no compliance requirements around money laundering are proving attractive for criminals using cryptocurrency, said Goodwin from the GAO. ""They can use that to evade detection and identification by law enforcement, and we found that to be a major challenge,"" she said.","How are organized crime groups in Brazil and Central America using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for extortion payments and money laundering, and what factors contribute to the attractiveness of cryptocurrencies for these activities in the region?","Organized crime groups in Brazil and Central America, such as the MS-13 gang, are using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for extortion payments and money laundering.

Additionally, criminals take advantage of unregulated exchanges that don't require proof of identification or registration information, as well as the services of ""tumblers"" who mix identifiable crypto with illegal funds to make them harder to trace.

3,"That has nothing to do with this.  The question that you raise is, can an assistant district attorney decapitate the federal government? Can an assistant district attorney cripple the executive branch?. HANSON: Mark, can an assistant district attorney in a local regional context assume the role of a federal prosecutor and indict the president of the united states for what would be a federal, if it were even true, would be a federal crime? Because they're talking about a conspiracy or racketeering to disrupt the ballot.  The ballot is not just Georgia, because Georgia is one state with an Electoral College. What Fani Willis is saying that Donald Trump tried to use Georgia to affect the entire United States in a federal manner and disrupt the federal election, so I'm not sure she has any jurisdiction.  But the point again is, is that, she is going to set a precedent and there is going to be a lot of other prosecutors that want a name for themselves, like she wants a name for herself, but they're going to be far more gifted and they are going to have far more grounds in the future to go after a president and we'll see what happens.  The only -- the tragic thing about this is whether it is Russian collusion or Russian disinformation with a laptop or the first impeachment or trying Trump as a private -- there's never any apology. There's another never any introspection. Maybe we were wrong about that, maybe we lied about it, maybe Hillary Clinton really did use three pay walls to disrupt an election by hiring a foreign national, which is illegal to do in Christopher Steele.  But they have no remorse, no regrets. It's always on to the next psychodrama.  LEVIN: What when we return and have a little more time in the next segment, Victor Davis Hanson, doesn't this underscore what they're doing? In other words, they want to be America's monopoly party. They want to turn the Republican Party into basically a minor party where we go through the motions of elections, but we know which party is going to win.","Has Fani Willis, an assistant district attorney, exceeded her jurisdiction by attempting to indict the president of the United States for federal crimes related to election disruption?","Yes, Fani Willis, an assistant district attorney, may have exceeded her jurisdiction by attempting to indict the president of the United States for federal crimes related to election disruption.

Imperial amnesia, first and foremost, why do you think that Europe is choosing to forget or ignore its imperial past rather than learn from it?. HANS KUNDNANI, EUROPE EXPERT, CHATHAM HOUSE: Well, I guess the simple answer is that it's a difficult past. It's a painful past. And it shows Europeans in less than a positive light. And so that's a difficult thing for any country or region to think about.

3,"A new challenger has emerged to Trump – and his extreme anti-woke message is working. He's never spent a day in public office. He's never even run for public office before, and he's a 37-year-old practicing Hindu who is vying for presidential primary votes from a Republican electorate that is overwhelmingly old, white and Christian.  So why does Vivek Ramaswamy 's unlikely presidential campaign seem to be catching on?. Over the last week, a succession of polls show the former biotech entrepreneur turned anti-woke author and asset manager turned political neophyte garnering support from as much as 10 per cent of GOP primary voters.  On one hand, that's not much considering the frontrunner, twice-impeached and twice-indicted former president Donald Trump , still holds a lead somewhere in the range of 24 to 43 per cent over his closest rivals.  But most of those same polls show Ramaswamy's support beating far more well-known and experienced political hands, including a former vice president (Mike Pence), three former governors (Nikki Haley, Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson) and a sitting US senator, Tim Scott.  And one survey of Ohio Republicans , released by Ohio Northern University on Friday, reveals that this complete newcomer to electoral politics has overtaken one of those governors – DeSantis – and is now the second choice of the Buckeye State GOP electorate after the former president.  At an event for all 13 candidates for the Republican nomination in Iowa on Friday, Ramaswamy got one of the biggest standing ovations of the night with a promise of ""revolution"" instead of reform.  A few short years ago, it would have been unthinkable for someone who'd never before run for office to be making such an impact in a presidential election.  Then a certain New York real estate developer-cum-reality television icon decided to run for president — and won.  So does Ramaswamy's traction in the Trump-era GOP field mean voters no longer care about experience? Should governors and senators worry that their odds of winning the highest office in the land will always be longer than the odds for some youngster with the money to self-fund?. Not exactly.","What factors have contributed to Vivek Ramaswamy's growing support in the Republican primary, and what implications does this have for experienced political candidates?","Vivek Ramaswamy's growing support in the Republican primary can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, his status as a political outsider and his background as a successful entrepreneur and author resonates with voters who are seeking a change from traditional politicians. Additionally, his anti-woke message appeals to a significant portion of the Republican electorate. Ramaswamy's ability to garner support despite his lack of political experience raises questions about the importance of experience for candidates in the current political climate. This could mean that experienced political candidates, such as former governors and senators, may face challenges in winning the highest office.",1888a9c47a5f4c11751d612a6536152f

(COMMERCIAL BREAK). MATTINGLY: We've got some new reporting this morning. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other top Republicans beginning to strategize how to move forward with an impeachment inquiry into President Biden this fall.  But skeptical GOP lawmakers, no evidence and government funding that's set to expire, all critical factors that could complicate their timelines.  CNN's Melanie Zanona joins us now with her new reporting. Mel, I think the initial question is, we'll try and figure out how to get to 218. They may not actually need 218 votes. It's just the most interesting part of your piece among many interesting parts. Walk us through.  [07:45:02]. MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Yes, that's exactly right, Phil. So just to walk viewers through the process, Republicans want to open an impeachment inquiry, which would be the first formal step towards impeachment proceedings. But there is no constitutional requirement that they actually need to have a floor vote.  And because, as you mentioned, Kevin McCarthy doesn't actually have the votes right now, amongst this conference.","What is the first formal step that Republicans want to take in initiating an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, and why is a floor vote not necessary for this step?","The first formal step that Republicans want to take in initiating an impeachment inquiry into President Biden is to open an impeachment inquiry, which would be the first step towards impeachment proceedings. However, a floor vote is not necessary for this step because there is no constitutional requirement for it. As mentioned in the excerpt, Kevin McCarthy does not currently have the votes within the Republican conference to proceed with a floor vote.",7695bd56928bf1988ad06633758c2599
3,"Having grown up and lived in West Virginia for most of his life, Workman said the state has traditionally been insulated from national politics. However, he noted that national political narratives now ""operate on a very local level."" As the relationship between party identification and cultural issues has grown, the national Democratic Party has fallen out of step with many in the state, particularly as energy has become a partisan focal point.  ""People's social values here really haven't changed,"" Workman told Newsweek. ""It's just that Republicans especially are having an easier time amplifying those issues to center people's votes, and Democrats have a harder time avoiding those sorts of things."". Additionally, Democratic control of state politics coincided with a statewide decline, Workman said. The state's population peaked at over 2 million people in 1950 but has dropped since, with a population of just 1.79 million today. Since at least 1990, it has ranked as one of the poorest states in the nation, and today it ranks as the fourth-poorest state.  Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito was the first national Republican to capitalize on these issues, becoming the first member of her party to represent West Virginia in Congress since 1983 after flipping the state's 2nd District in 2000. When she was elected to the Senate in 2015, Capito became the first Republican to represent West Virginia in the upper chamber since 1959.  Capito believes the Democratic party's stance on environmental issues, gun rights, and general ""pocketbook"" issues have contributed to her party's rise in the state.  ""I think policies of the Democrat[ic] Party are far removed from the working men and women in West Virginia,"" Capito told Newsweek. ""I think it's been that over time, and then solutions that we've offered as Republicans I think are much more in line with how West Virginians think."". Can Democrats Reverse Rural Redness?. . The issue of Democrats falling out of line with how voters think in rural and blue-collar states has persisted for some time.","How has the Democratic party's stance on environmental issues, gun rights, and ""pocketbook"" issues contributed to the rise of the Republican party in West Virginia?","The Democratic party's stance on environmental issues, gun rights, and ""pocketbook"" issues has contributed to the rise of the Republican party in West Virginia.

The upcoming remake features only one actor with dwarfism, with their six companions played by non-dwarf actors.  The absence of dwarfs has sparked backlash online, but the idea of seven dwarfs appearing in the remake also proved controversial.  Appearing on Marc Maron's WTF podcast, Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage dismissed Disney's remake as a ""f**king backwards story,"" stating that he ""was a little taken aback when [Disney] were very proud to cast a Latina actress as Snow White, but you are still telling the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."". In response to Dinklage's comments, Disney stated that ""to avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community."". Dinklage's interview prompted other actors with dwarfism to object to his comments, with some expressing concern that future acting roles could be lost.  Actress Katrina Kemp described the casting as ""a missed opportunity to make a movie with seven little people where they actually have intended characters. There will have been people who gladly would have taken those roles."". Rachel Zegler controversial comments. Zegler is known to talk off the cuff when promoting her films, speaking with blunt humor instead of bland PR speak, having joked that she took a role in Shazam 2 because she ""needed a job."". While promoting Snow White last year, Zegler made a series of offhand comments in which she playfully mocks the original animation.  Zegler's comments were recently unearthed by TikTok, sparking a wave of surprisingly fierce criticism from creators who accused Zegler of ""hating"" Snow White and having a ""pseudo-feminist"" take on the original animation.  What did Rachel Zegler say?. While speaking to Entertainment Weekly back in December, the West Side Story star said she was ""scared of the original version,"" having ""watched it once and never picked it up again."".",What were Rachel Zegler's offhand comments about the original animation of Snow White?,"Rachel Zegler made a series of offhand comments in which she playfully mocks the original animation of Snow White.

Memoirs by the former Russian official Konstantin Pulikovsky, drawing from a report by a Russian Foreign Ministry note-taker on board the train in 2001 during Kim Jong Il's one-month ride across Russia, paint a picture of luxury. Pulikovsky claimed the train was conducted by beautiful women and loaded with extravagant dishes and wine, according to a 2002 New York Times article.  ""It was possible to order any dish of Russian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and French cuisine,"" Pulikovsky wrote, according to the Times. Live lobsters were taken to train stations along the route, and cases of Bordeaux and Burgundy red wines were reportedly delivered, Pulikovsky wrote.  CNN could not independently verify The New York Times account.  Other reports over the years by South Korean media have highlighted the train's security features. According to a 2009 report in South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo, the train is so heavily armored that it travels at an average speed of 60 kilometers an hour (about 37 miles mph).  It contained conference rooms, an audience chamber and bedrooms and featured satellite phone connections and flat screen televisions, the paper reported at the time.  ""Before Kim's train nears the station, the power on other tracks is shut off so that no other trains can move,"" the paper reported.  Kim Jong Un on board. The North Korea of today is a far cry from that era at the start of the millennium when Pulikovsky's reports of largesse and luxuries on board the train were made.  International sanctions clamped down again in 2003 after North Korea continued its nuclear weapons program and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Information from inside the country slowed to a trickle, even more so in recent years under Kim Jong Un's rule.

3,"But there is also disagreement when it comes to the Republican conference itself. With that spending bill, GOP hardliners have already outlined some of what they want to see to pass that bill. That includes an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, action on border security, and cutting spending to pre-COVID levels.  [17:40:01]. So, all of this is really coming to a head. It will be a headache for House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. But we should also note it could have ramifications for the economy and there, President Biden has labeled the economy Bidenomics, so key for him, too.  ACOSTA: Absolutely. All right, Priscilla Alvarez, thanks so much. Joining us now to talk about this, Democratic Congressman Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. We appreciate it, especially on this Labor Day weekend. What do you make of these Republican threats to shut down the government? What can be done about this? Do you think it's going to happen?. REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA): What a difference a year makes. Democrats closed last summer investing in domestic manufacturing, empowering Medicare, negotiate drug prices, passing the biggest, boldest climate change in clean energy legislation in history. Fast forward one year, Republicans are threatening to shut down the government, really just to protect Donald Trump from accountability. It's shameful.  And what Kevin McCarthy is going to need to do is (INAUDIBLE) the most extreme hardliners in his conference. There are 25, 35, 45 members of that conference who are just not serious about governing. They're nihilistic. And insofar, as you let the tail wag the dog, the government is going to shut down.  Now, if you want to step up and we a true leader of the chamber and put together a bipartisan consensus like we did to raise the debt limit, then I think we can govern.","What are some of the Republican demands in order to pass the spending bill, and what potential impact could a government shutdown have on the economy?","Some of the Republican demands in order to pass the spending bill include an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, action on border security, and cutting spending to pre-COVID levels. A potential government shutdown, which the Republicans are threatening, could have negative ramifications for the economy. It could create uncertainty and instability, which could undermine business confidence and consumer spending. It could also disrupt government services and delay payments to government employees and contractors, affecting their livelihoods.

3,"So who would determine that?. BROWNE-MARSHALL: Well, that's one of the concerns because if he is not charged with participating in a rebellion or insurrection, then it's going to be up to something that Mitch McConnell is saying, each person to decide what constitutes a rebellion or an insurrection. And then, determining if he did participate, did he lead it, or was a participant in it? He still claims that all he did was say, let's go to the Capitol. You know, and that was the extent.  We know there was much more to that because it was very much circumstantial, and some direct, but not direct enough, to clearly, I would think, charge him with that. But once again, as you pointed out, once he is charged, then there has to be conviction to determine that it was a rebellion or insurrection. When this was created, these, this 14th amendment back in 1868, it was very clear that these states had participated in a rebellion and instruction. It was the civil war.  And since then, of course, Congress, and other conservatives within Congress during the time have debated whether or not that disabilities remain in place, or was there amnesty of some sort. That is in the law view article that's coming up from the University of Pennsylvania. But I do think that at this point, whether or not there is a challenge by Donald Trump for being left off of the ballot, or being put on, and being challenged by the people. In the end, it's going to the U.S. Supreme Court.  WALKER: Wow, a lot of uncharted waters here. Gloria Browne-Marshall, we really appreciate you joining us this morning. Thank you.  And be sure to check out Gloria's book, ""She Took Justice: The Black Woman, Law and Power, 1619 to 1969"".","What is the process for determining whether someone participated in a rebellion or insurrection, and what historical event does the 14th amendment refer to?","The process for determining whether someone participated in a rebellion or insurrection is not clearly defined. It would be up to individuals to decide what constitutes a rebellion or an insurrection. In the case mentioned in the excerpt, it is mentioned that the person in question claims to have only encouraged others to go to the Capitol, but there is evidence suggesting there was more to it. The determination of participation and leadership would likely be based on circumstantial and direct evidence.

The Fortescue Metals chief executive, Fiona Hick, is leaving the iron ore miner just six months after taking on the top role, the latest in a wave of high-level resignations.  The change comes during a period marked by huge executive staff turnover at the Andrew Forrest-founded miner, and the pursuit of a new growth leg in hydrogen and clean energy projects.  Fortescue said in a statement Hick made a joint decision with the board to leave.  ""The departure of Fiona has been both friendly and mutual and we warmly wish her the best for her future,"" Fortescue said in a statement on Monday.  Hick joined Fortescue from Woodside in February. There does not appear to be any transition period, with her successor, the former head of operations Dino Otranto, taking over immediately.  Analysts quizzed Fortescue on the reasons for the high-level change, only to be told it was a planned move and part of an expedited appointment.  The majority of Fortescue's executive team have left or shifted roles since 2021, representing at least 10 major changes in less than three years.  The longtime finance head Ian Wells resigned in January, shortly after the former deputy Reserve Bank governor Guy Debelle left his executive role. Debelle was recovering from a serious bicycle crash at the time and stayed with the company in a different position.  The ownership structure at Fortescue is also subject to change after the separation of the country's wealthiest couple, made public in July.  The Forrests said at the time their decision to live apart would not affect their shared philanthropic or business interests, which includes more than a one-third stake in Fortescue.

The debate had been seen as a potentially pivotal moment for DeSantis, whose campaign has been riven by staff turmoil amid a slow but steady decline in the polls.  Trump, who remains the clear-cut favorite among Republican voters despite his four criminal indictments, chose to skip the event in favor of a friendly interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that began streaming online minutes before the debate began. The interview had about 74 million views on X, formerly known as Twitter, during its 46 minutes.  Trump declined to directly answer provocative questions posed by Carlson, such as whether a civil war was coming in the United States. Instead, he stuck to well-worn themes: false claims that he won the 2020 election, a promise to tighten immigration controls and insults of President Joe Biden and some of his Republican rivals.  ""Do I sit there for an hour, or two hours, whatever it's going to be, and get harassed by people that shouldn't even be running for president and a network that isn't particularly friendly to me?"" he asked Carlson.  The debate took place a day before Trump planned to surrender in Atlanta to face charges he sought to overturn his election loss in the state.

3,"Extracting actionable insights from this data allows organizations to proactively identify emerging threats and vulnerabilities.  An e-commerce company may use a threat intelligence platform that leverages AI to monitor social media for discussions related to its brand. If the platform detects a sudden increase in mentions of the company along with keywords and patterns, it can automatically alert the security team so that it can investigate and respond promptly.  Automated Remediation. AI can automate the remediation process by initiating predefined actions based on incident categorization and severity. This capability reduces the need for manual intervention and accelerates incident response times. These systems can execute actions such as isolating compromised systems, blocking malicious IP addresses or quarantining infected files.  A healthcare organization may deploy an AI-driven endpoint protection solution to detect a malware infection on a workstation. If it does, it can automatically isolate the affected device from the network, preventing lateral movement and further damage.  Challenges Surrounding AI Cybersecurity Implementation. As enterprises increasingly embrace AI in their cybersecurity strategies, they also encounter various challenges that must be overcome for successful implementation.  Quality Of Data. AI algorithms rely heavily on large volumes of high-quality data to train and improve their accuracy. However, many enterprises struggle to gather sufficient and relevant data due to factors such as data silos, privacy concerns and regulatory constraints.  A multinational organization may find it challenging to aggregate and normalize security logs from various subsidiaries spread across different regions, each using different systems and formats. Without access to comprehensive and diverse data, the models may not achieve optimal results, leading to less effective threat detection and response.  Adversarial Attacks. Cyberattackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their methods, leveraging adversarial attacks to deceive AI systems. Adversarial attacks involve manipulating input data to mislead these algorithms and evade detection. Enterprises must continually invest in research and development to enhance the resilience of their AI models against such attacks.  Moreover, AI-powered systems in cybersecurity are prone to generating false positives—mistakenly identifying harmless activities as malicious threats. False positives can lead to alert fatigue and divert valuable resources toward investigating nonexistent threats, potentially causing disruptions in business operations.",What are some challenges that enterprises face when implementing AI cybersecurity strategies?,"Some challenges that enterprises face when implementing AI cybersecurity strategies include the quality of data available for training AI algorithms.

3,"The consequences of these trade policies are particularly pronounced in urban areas, as evidenced by an increase in poverty among urban families, whereas rural families seem to have been relatively less impacted.  Regrettably, Pakistan has been grappling with a myriad of challenges in social, economic, and political spheres for an extended period. Issues like communal distrust, economic stagnation, political instability, moral decay, and reliance on foreign aid demand urgent attention and resolution. Indeed, the key to surmounting these crises lies in prioritizing and revitalizing our education sector.  However, Pakistan's lackluster interest in uplifting the education system has led the nation astray from the path of progress and development. Consequently, a thorough examination of the obstacles plaguing the educational sector is indispensable.  The very roots of Pakistan's present impediments can be traced back to its failure to accord the education sector the importance it deserves. Elevating the quality of schooling and higher education is the pivotal step towards shaping our destiny. Without significant advancements in our education system, the aspiration of transforming Pakistan into a self-reliant, progressive, and technologically advanced nation will remain an elusive dream.  The government's unwavering commitment to providing free, compulsory, and high-quality education to all Pakistani children is of paramount importance. Here, the Education Parliamentarians' Caucus Pakistan plays a pivotal role in driving this endeavor. To bring about a transformative change, our educational system necessitates comprehensive reforms encompassing infrastructural upgrades and curriculum modernization. The National Education Policy must cater to the demands of the contemporary age, fostering a future-ready learning environment. Raising awareness and advocating for universal education for all children is an urgent call that requires the concerted efforts of parents, teachers, and community leaders alike.  Investing in teacher training programs and offering enhanced incentives for educators can substantially elevate education quality and student achievement. Moreover, the proliferation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) dedicated to enhancing education presents a promising avenue. The efforts of NGOs such as The Citizens Foundation and Zindagi Trust, striving to provide high-quality education in underserved regions, offering scholarships to students from low-income families, and improving teacher training and support, are commendable steps towards empowering the nation's educational landscape.",What are some potential solutions to improving Pakistan's education system and overcoming its current challenges?,"Some potential solutions to improving Pakistan's education system and overcoming its current challenges are highlighted in the excerpt.

Today U.K. authorities also coming out saying that they think it is highly likely he was on board this plane. And as to whether who was behind it, well, that is still unknown, but President Biden had clear words yesterday. He said there is not much that happens in Russia that Putin is not behind. And I think that really speaks to the international sentiment around this incident.

3,"Blue Beetle dethrones Barbie at the Box Office  'Strays' struggles for attention. The dynamics of the box office are experiencing a transformation as the enduring frontrunner, Barbie, yields its prime position to the freshest superhero contender from DC, Blue Beetle.  The box office landscape is undergoing a shift, with the long-standing champion Barbie relinquishing its top spot to DC's latest superhero offering, Blue Beetle.  Blue Beetle's Flight to Success. Blue Beetle, a DC superhero flick, is predicted to open with an impressive range of $25 million to $27 million across North America. It marked an auspicious start on Friday, accruing $10 million, with $3.3 million generated from previews.  However, the looming impact of an approaching hurricane on box office collections, particularly in Los Angeles and Southern California, remains uncertain.  Not-So-Sunny Skies for Blue Beetle. While Blue Beetle's performance is notable, it's still short of initial expectations. Pre-weekend projections had pointed towards a range of $28 million to $32 million. Additionally, the movie is facing one of the lowest openings ever within the DC Extended Universe, without accounting for inflation.  A Trailblazing Latino Superhero. Directed by Ángel Manuel Soto, Blue Beetle marks Hollywood's pioneering venture into a live-action superhero film centered on a Latino protagonist. This release aspires to break new ground for Latino representation, both on and off the screen. Xolo Maridueña stars as the titular character, supported by an ensemble cast including Adriana Barraza, Damían Alcázar, Raoul Max Trujillo, Susan Sarandon, George Lopez, Elpidia Carrillo, Bruna Marquezine, Belissa Escobedo, Harvey Guillén, and Becky G.  Exit polling service PostTrak reveals that a significant 40 percent of Friday's ticket purchasers were Latino, a notable increase from the usual 30 percent.  Challenges Amid Striking Times.

3,"NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. And actually, it was the family's request, the victim family's, Eddie Irizarry, their request that the entire body cam footage be released to the public. Now, yes, as you just mentioned, Irizarry, I have actually seen other footage that was released by their family attorney shortly after this shooting happened in Philadelphia on August 14th.  And I want to make this a point because this is why it's kind of raised a lot of alarm in the community and Philadelphia itself. Because when this happened, police in Philadelphia initially said that Irizarry was shot while he was outside of his car and he wasn't obeying commands from police after being pulled over. But it's very clear when you see that body cam footage and other footage, again, that was brought forward by the family's attorney, that he was inside his car. And that was the major issue here is that police did not give an accurate description of what happened initially and had to somewhat give a mea culpa. And then now we have the videos from the incident in its entirety.  And so that's where we are right now. That police officer Mark Dial, he fired those shots very soon after he got out of his police car, giving very little warning before firing those shots. And as you pointed out, actually saying I'm going to shoot you right before firing those shots. And as far as that officer, he was immediately put on leave by the police department with the expectation of being fired. He has been fired and today he turned himself in, but he's facing some very serious charges. He's facing murder charges. He's facing aggravated assault charges. There's just a number of them that he is going to have to answer to and defend himself against. I want you to hear from his defense attorney.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP). BRIAN MCMONAGLE, ATTORNEY FOR OFFICER MARK DIAL: We intend to right this wrong.",Why did the victim's family request for the entire body cam footage to be released to the public and what were the initial inaccuracies in the police's description of the incident?,"The victim's family requested the release of the entire body cam footage to the public because they wanted to provide a complete and accurate account of the incident.

Once it moves into water temperatures that are about 30 degrees Celsius.  All right, here's the open Gulf of Mexico. But where does it want to go? Well the computer models are in pretty good agreement. It looks like it is going to just kind of remain offshore the west coast of Florida.  For Tampa, probably not going to be a landfall, meaning the eye of the storm moves over Tampa, that hasn't happened for over 100 years but it's still going to be an impact not just for Tampa, but for our Cape Coral, for Naples, for Clearwater, St. Pete.  You are looking at a storm surge that could be several meters. And rainfall that could be between 75 and about 200 millimeters.  Well, as we go into the forecast time period Tuesday evening, category 2. Wednesday morning, category 3. And it's going to be just offshore.  And this very fragile area, the good news, if we could say that, is that this is not densely populated, not like it is along this west coast.

MGM Resorts is the company targeted in this attack. But executives there are currently saying very little beyond confirming that MGM is indeed the victim of a cyberattack that apparently began Sunday night and appears to have affected most if not all of MGM's properties across eight states.  Including flagship hotels such as the MGM Grand, the Bellagio, and New York, New York, all in Las Vegas, where MGM has a total of more than 45,000 hotel rooms.  In its one brief statement, MGM acknowledged that some systems were down and offered customers phone numbers to reach hotels if they couldn't use the online booking and other services.  MGM said an investigation is ongoing, and that as soon as the company became aware of the attack, it ""took prompt action to protect our systems and data, including shutting down certain systems."". Now some customers reported that they could not get into their hotel rooms with their digital keys, and there are reports that many of the high-tech slot machines on casino floors was shut down as well as ATM machines not working.  Now, the apparent cyber-attack follows a string of similar hacks, including one against various U.S. government agencies in June that targeted the Department of Energy among others, exploiting a software vulnerability and an August attack on a healthcare company that operates 16 hospitals and 165 clinics in three states, including here in California.  Meantime, the priority right now for MGM is getting control of its systems. Once they have done that, they will be urgently working to fix whatever vulnerability the attackers exploited.  And to begin working out, how much damage has been done, not just to the company, but potentially to the millions of people who have entrusted MGM hotels and casinos with their financial information.

In another part of the state, more than 200 miles away, in the most free, rural, and heavily Republican Coffee County, Trump got nearly 70 percent of the vote there.

He quoted Dudinets as saying: ""Naturally, I was fully aware that I might not make it back. But it would have been instant death if the tank had been hit and the explosives had gone off."". The 128th Brigade said on Facebook that it used a Russian T-62 tank. The UK's defense ministry says these tanks were first adopted by the Soviet Union in 1961, which stopped building new ones in the 1970s.  Russia has been using decades-old tanks in its invasion of Ukraine due to its shortages of modern equipment. Ukraine has a lot of the same equipment, thanks to its past as part of the Soviet Union, and a small number of advance Western tanks.  The brigade said it captured the T-62 from Russia earlier in the war, as Russian troops fled in the Kherson region last fall.  The brigade described T-62s as outdated and poorly protected. It said its gun was damaged and that it was used as a tractor before they decided to turn it into a rolling bomb.

3,"In the past three decades, VAD has led to millions of child deaths in less these countries —around 2 million each year in the early 1990s alone — though the figure fell to an estimated 105,700 by 2013. Specifically affecting children under 5, VAD still remains a global concern, even as total cases of the deficiency decreased from 877 million to 490 million from 1990 to 2019.  VAD is common in the Global South, but rare in the Global North, according to the World Health Organization. Golden Rice proponents say it arises from limited dietary diversity due to poverty, market constraints, and agronomic factors, affecting people in poorer nations who have restricted access to vitamin A-rich foods, while consumers in wealthier countries with higher incomes enjoy more diverse diets.  When a country approves Golden Rice for use, its government must assess its environmental safety for cultivation and human and animal consumption, adhering to the ""precautionary principle"" outlined in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. This ""better safe than sorry"" principle also calls for restricting a product of biotechnology in the face of a possible or unknown risk. Activists see this principle as a safeguard for public and environmental health, but supporters of GMOs say it only hinders the advancement of Golden Rice research, development, release, and widespread adoption in front of unfounded claims.  In the Philippines, the Department of Agriculture's Philippine Rice Research Institute (DA–PhilRice) is spearheading Golden Rice's development and deployment, partnering with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), also headquartered in the country. The DA's Bureau of Plant Industries issued a biosafety permit for Malusog Rice in December 2019, attesting that it's ""as safe as conventional rice"" following set regulations.  Between 2016 and 2018, food safety regulators in Australia and New Zealand, Canada, and the United States reviewed the biosafety application documents for Malusog Rice and confirmed its safety for consumption, PhilRice said.  The WHO has not yet issued guidance on the consumption of biofortified foods, like Golden Rice, for preventing VAD, the organization told Mongabay.","What are some of the factors that contribute to vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in countries of the Global South, according to the World Health Organization?","According to the World Health Organization, limited dietary diversity due to poverty, market constraints, and agronomic factors contribute to vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in countries of the Global South.

3,"Janet Protasiewicz, a Milwaukee County judge, won by 11 points and flipped control of the court to give liberals a 4-3 majority when she was sworn in on Aug. 1. Protasiewicz, who declined interview requests, spoke openly during her campaign about her support for abortion rights and opposition to what she called ""rigged"" maps that have given Republicans large majorities in the state legislature. Political strategists said her blunt style helped her win even as court observers fretted that she was making judges look like politicians instead of evenhanded referees.  The tensions surrounding the Wisconsin court reflect the state's political importance nationally and the increasingly partisan nature of a system in which candidates who vow to be impartial arbiters of the law are chosen by voters in heated political campaigns. Justices are directly elected by voters in 21 states and they must stand for retention elections after being appointed in another 17.  Across the country, deadlocked statehouses and all-or-nothing politics have given state supreme courts more power and often put them in charge of determining election outcomes and abortion policies. The changeover on the Wisconsin Supreme Court comes less than a year after conservatives took over the top court in North Carolina and strengthened their hold on the one in Ohio. In North Carolina, the new majority acted swiftly, handing Republicans victories by reversing decisions the court had made just months earlier on voter ID and redistricting.  Conservatives for decades had the upper hand in supreme court races in key states by fielding judges and prosecutors as candidates, sharpening tough-on-crime messages and securing the support of deep-pocketed groups aligned with Republicans. But in recent years, liberals in Wisconsin have recruited candidates with similar backgrounds and seized on popular political themes. The state Democratic Party, meanwhile, has poured millions of dollars into what are ostensibly nonpartisan races.  The strategy culminated in Protasiewicz's victory and elicited cheers from liberals across the country. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Protasiewicz would ""protect democracy as the state's newest Supreme Court justice."" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) hailed her victory as a ""HUGE night for the progressive movement.""","What political positions did Janet Protasiewicz openly support during her campaign for Wisconsin Supreme Court, and how did her election affect the ideological balance of the court?","Janet Protasiewicz openly supported abortion rights and opposed what she called ""rigged"" maps that have given Republicans large majorities in the state legislature during her campaign for the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

3,"Global green growth stalled by climate finance shortfalls (commentary). There is growing consensus that green growth – economic growth that is environmentally sustainable – is both possible and desirable: the green economy is estimated to represent $1.3 trillion in annual sales in the U.S. alone. Calls for worldwide green growth in recent years have come from far and wide, from the United Nations to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and others, but commitments to fund this growth continually fall short. Ahead of the upcoming Sustainable Development Goals Summit in mid-September, a new op-ed argues that this event offers a chance for world leaders to make progress on climate finance and green growth, to boost sustainable growth while limiting losses due to multiplying environmental crises. This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the authors, not necessarily Mongabay.  A recent Gallup poll found that 43% of Americans believe that economic growth should be a higher priority than environmental protection.  But this is a false dichotomy. There is growing consensus that green growth – economic growth that is environmentally sustainable – is both possible and desirable. In the U.S. alone, the green economy is estimated to represent $1.3 trillion in annual sales revenue and to employ nearly 9.5 million workers. And last year, global trade of green goods – products that are designed to use fewer resources or emit less pollution than their traditional counterparts – held strong throughout the year, defying the downward overall global trade trend.  Clarion calls for green growth in recent years have come far and wide, from the United Nations to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Many governments from developed countries and regions have begun to implement green growth policies into their national development strategies, most notably with the adoption of the European Green Deal in 2020.  Natural resources like fisheries still dominate many developing countries' economies: tuna is the Maldives' biggest export, for example. Image by Asian Development Bank via Flickr (CC BY-NC 2.0).

3,"In a story published in August, The New York Times explained that Ukraine's government sought US F-16 fighters to supplement its fleet of Soviet-era jets to increase its ""advantage over Russia's air force and also to improve its own air defenses.""  According to the Times, ""F-16s would enhance the country's ground-launched air defenses, which are used to fight off Russian missile attacks and could also act as a deterrent to Moscow in the longer term because they could erase its aerial superiority."" By the end of August, another report explained that ""Zelensky had secured promises from a half-dozen countries to either donate the jets — potentially more than 60 — or provide training for pilots and support crew.""   James Robbins, a military analyst, in the publication 1945 argues: ""adding advanced air capabilities would represent a significant force multiplier.""  Such a move  ""would transform the current status quo – which Ukrainian pilots have likened to flying 'suicide missions' against Russian jets – and level the playing field, making the skies over Ukraine safer for Ukrainian fighters and other aircraft by suppressing Russian air defenses.""  A report in February of this year explained that Ukraine had lost 53 combat fighters since the start of the war. David French summarized Ukraine's military disadvantage as follows: ""Generation 4.5 fighters include upgraded models of the American F-15, F-16 and F-18, as well as the Eurofighter Typhoon, Sweden's Saab JAS-39 Gripen and France's Dassault Rafale. Crucially, the list also includes the Russian Su-30, Su-34 and Su-35. Russia has hundreds of generation 4.5 fighters. Ukraine has none. Instead it has a few dozen Soviet-era fourth-generation fighters."" French cited Ukraine's defense minister as arguing that Ukraine's planes ""have a more limited capacity to provide air defense within the country and no ability to create air superiority at or near the zero line, the very edge of the battlefront.""",What advantages would acquiring F-16 fighters provide to Ukraine's military?,"Acquiring F-16 fighters would provide several advantages to Ukraine's military. According to reports, F-16s would enhance Ukraine's ground-launched air defenses, which are used to fight off Russian missile attacks. The presence of F-16s would also act as a deterrent to Russia in the longer term, as it would erase Russia's aerial superiority. Additionally, acquiring advanced air capabilities like F-16s would level the playing field and make the skies over Ukraine safer for Ukrainian fighters and other aircraft by suppressing Russian air defenses. This would transform the current status quo, where Ukrainian pilots have likened their flights to ""suicide missions"" against Russian jets.",29fbc4cf5be91752d2e932f9b10c94ad

3,"But much more product innovation and dissemination is needed to make it a part of global cuisine, akin to say quinoa.  Is it possible for India to turn this aspirational framework into a reality at home? The answer lies in re-thinking its agri-policies to prioritise the well-being of people and the planet. Current policies of open-ended and assured procurement with Minimum Support Price (MSP) for say paddy and wheat, coupled with massive subsidies on fertilisers, power, and irrigation, have caused damage to our natural resources, especially soil, water, air, and biodiversity.

But will what you wear increase your chance of being harassed?"". This was the provocative question that a prominent male political science professor, Liu Qing of East China Normal University, asked the three female hosts of Stochastic Volatility, the largest feminist-themed podcast in China. . What followed was an episode full of sincere and honest questions in which hosts Fu Shiye, Zhang Zhiqi, and Leng Jianguo picked apart the professor's reasoning. . ""On the one hand, we know that he was so outdated on the information and the discussions surrounding these issues,"" Zhang says. ""But on the other hand, we felt that he was genuinely confused. He asked those questions in a very friendly tone."". Together every week, Fu, Zhang, and Leng continue to host discussions like these on their podcast, which has around 600,000 regular listeners. They talk about things that are often considered taboo in Chinese society. One episode discusses egg freezing and fertility treatments, another discusses the sexualization of women's clothing, while another episode talks about why some breast cancer survivors choose not to undergo breast reconstruction. .

U.S. national security officials are raising concerns about the risks artificial intelligence poses to national security, with the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Jen Easterly, warning of a ""world in the not-too-distant future where how-to guides, AI-generated imagery, auto-generated shopping lists are available for terrorists and for criminals, providing the capability to develop things like cyber weapons, chemical weapons, [and] bio weapons."". At a recent conference, Craig Martell, the chief digital and AI officer for the Department of Defense, said ""he is 'scared to death' of the potential for generative artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT to deceive citizens and threaten national security."". At the April RSA Cybersecurity Conference, Rob Joyce, the National Security Agency's cybersecurity director, noted that he expects AI to aid criminals in creating more effective phishing attacks and help attackers modify existing malware to bypass security tools and software.  Generative AI Poses Security Threats. Armed with these warnings, we at Paladin Capital Group decided to ask ChatGPT about the cybersecurity concerns of generative AI. ChatGPT came back with a litany of responses, including using the model to manipulate and deceive. This refers to the ability to create convincing deepfakes that could be used to spread disinformation and disrupt elections or impersonate someone to gain unauthorized access to a system.  Generative AI could also bypass authentication systems using contextual password guessing. By training a large language model on the personal data available on the internet, such as social media profiles and public records, attackers can make highly targeted password guesses. This method is more effective than traditional attacks because it reduces the number of possible passwords, making it more likely to work.  These capabilities undermine the authentication paradigm and threaten U.S. national security.",What are the concerns raised by U.S. national security officials about the risks of generative artificial intelligence and its potential impact on national security?,"U.S. national security officials have raised concerns about the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential impact on national security.

3,"NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: As with all of these types of deals, both sides seem need to be seen by their prospective constituencies to be walking away with a success. So no surprise, there's contention about one of the central parts of this, which is the money the $6 billion.  We heard from the Iranian Central Bank Governor a little while ago, and he explained how the mechanism has been sort of been put in place since the middle of August. So getting to the point of making a deal that has been the subject of talks through intermediaries Qatar, for about 18 months, gives you an idea of the length.  Just getting the financial side right, the transfer of funds that were controlled by South Korea, that were frozen funds, Iranian money.  FOSTER: Not American money?. ROBERTSON: Not American money, but frozen to Qatari banks and Iran opening bank accounts in Tehran to access this. But that contentious point that I mentioned is what happens to that money. Now Iran says we can use that money as the government sees fit, that's what the President has said.  The United States has been very clear that it can be used for humanitarian use only for medicines, for food to support the people in Iran. And there will be controls on that the Qataris are controlling the accounts. The U.S. Treasury will be watching the way that it works.  But yes, a hugely complex deal. And you're right. I mean, the biggest thing today is going to be the emotion of those five people when they set foot in a country that it is not locking them up wrongfully detained. That's how the U.S. has said. So we can only begin to imagine how this must feel for that.",What is the contention surrounding the $6 billion in the Iran deal and how do Iran and the United States differ in their views on how the money should be used?,"The contention surrounding the $6 billion in the Iran deal is regarding how the money should be used.

DOUG BURGUM (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, Martha, thanks for having us on. And of course, again, the fact that we've been listening to this for 50 minutes and there's barely been a mention of China is kind of shocking to me. You can have all the summits you want, but if we're not talking about changing energy policy, and I feel like if you're having summits, it's not going to change if China's writing the Biden energy policy.  And when I say that, if we've got an energy policy that says we're going to get rid of oil and gas in America, and we're going to buy all of our batteries from China, and we're going to subsidize charging stations, subsidize electric vehicles, subsidize batteries that China's making, it changes nothing.",What does Governor Doug Burgum believe is missing from the trilateral press conference and how does he think it impacts US foreign policy and trade?,"Governor Doug Burgum believes that the trilateral press conference between the leaders of the Republic of Korea, Japan, and the United States failed to address the issue of China.

He specifically mentions concerns about the energy policy that seeks to eliminate oil and gas in the US and rely on China for batteries, electric vehicles, and charging stations, which he believes will not bring about any meaningful change.

Cuban authorities have arrested 17 people in connection with what they described as a network to recruit Cuban nationals to fight for Russia in Ukraine.  The head of criminal investigations for Cuba's Interior Ministry, César Rodríguez, said late Thursday on state media that at least three of the 17 people arrested are part of recruitment efforts inside the island country.  The official didn't identify the alleged members of the network, but said they had previous criminal records. Some families started speaking up about the case, and at least one mother said that her son was promised a job in construction in Russia.  Cuba's Foreign Ministry said Monday that the government had detected a network operating from Russia to recruit Cuban citizens living both in Russia and in Cuba to fight in Ukraine, and it said the authorities were working ""to neutralize and dismantle"" the network, but it gave no details.

Prosecutor José Luis Reyes told state TV that suspects are being investigated for crimes including being a mercenary or recruiting mercenaries, and could face sentences of up to 30 years or life in prison, or even the death penalty.  Marilin Vinent, 60, said Friday that her son Dannys Castillo, 27, is one of the Cubans recruited in Russia.  In her home in Havana, she said that her son and other Cubans traveled at the end of July to Russia after being promised work in a construction job. ""They were all deceived,"" she said.  Vinent showed reporters photos of her son in her cellphone, including some of him dressed in military fatigues.

3,"World Food Programme in Yemen may 'have to take from hungry to feed starving'. Four million face aid cuts as UN agency says less than a third of next six-month $1.05bn budget for needy is funded. The UN's World Food Programme says it is being forced to reduce assistance to more than four million people in Yemen because of a lack of money.  The WFP said on Friday that it expects that as many as three million people in northern Yemen and 1.4 million in the south will be affected.  The UN said Yemen, the Arabian Peninsula's poorest country, is in the grip of one of the world's worst humanitarian crises after eight years of war.  Seventeen million Yemenis are suffering food insecurity, and one million women and 2.2 million children under five need treatment for acute malnutrition.  The WFP said that ""a deeper funding crisis"" for its Yemen operations from the end of September was forcing the agency ""to make difficult decisions about further cuts to our food assistance programmes across the country in the coming months"".  ""We are confronted with the incredibly tough reality of making decisions to take food from the hungry to feed the starving,"" the WFP statement quoted Richard Ragan, its Yemen representative, as saying.  He said the agency was ""fully cognisant of the suffering these cuts will cause"".  The WFP said it required $1.05 billion in funding for the next six months, only 28 per cent of which has been secured.  ""Yemen will remain one of WFP's largest food assistance operations, but these cuts represent a significant reduction to the agency's programmes in the country,"" it said.  ""The funding shortages are happening at a time of more people becoming severely malnourished."". The agency was forced to cut food aid for 13 million Yemenis by more than half in June last year because of a funding squeeze.  Yemen's conflict broke out in 2014, when Iran-backed Houthi rebels seized the capital Sanaa, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene the following year to prop up the internationally recognised government.  Although fighting has remained largely on hold since a six-month truce expired in October, the UN said current hunger levels are unprecedented.","According to the excerpt, why is the World Food Programme being forced to reduce assistance to people in Yemen?","The World Food Programme is being forced to reduce assistance to people in Yemen due to a lack of funding. The organization stated that it requires $1.05 billion in funding for the next six months, but only 28 percent of this amount has been secured.

He will be holding a meeting with Putin in the city of Vladivostok, according to local media reports.  Meanwhile, the United States has warned Russia and North Korea of the consequences if the latter provides weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine.  ""I will remind both countries that any transfer of arms from North Korea to Russia would be in violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions"", US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on Monday.  ""We, of course, have aggressively enforced our sanctions against entities that fund Russia's war effort, and we will continue to enforce those sanctions and will not hesitate to impose new sanctions if appropriate."". Miller also underlined that Putin reaching out for help from an ""international pariah"" is a testimony to the fact that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been ""a strategic failure"".  Both North Korea and Russia are already under several US sanctions.

The governor's office said Thursday that Fiordaliso died Wednesday. It didn't provide a cause of death.  Fiordaliso, who had been president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities since 2018, often spoke of his grandchildren when describing the type of planet he hoped to leave to them — one in which green energy sources like wind, solar and geothermal help reduce the worst effects of climate change by replacing the burning of fossil fuels.  Gov. Phil Murphy called Fiordaliso, who was born in Newark, ""a consummate public servant, a trusted colleague, and a good friend."".

3,"But the next generation of keyboard apps quickly surpassed its predecessors. .  In 2006, Sogou was released, essentially combining the foundation of pinyin typing and the tech of a search engine. Just as search engines recommend content that's closest to what people are asking about, keyboard software can predict what users may want to type.  .  With Sogou, the candidate characters and words are no longer displayed in a permanent order; the order changes based on a user's typing history and what's in the news. For example, now that I've typed 毅 a few times in this newsletter already, Sogou remembers that and puts it at the top whenever I type yi . .  Many other innovative IMEs were invented around the same time as Sogou. Some tried to combine the methods based on shapes with those based on spelling. Others enabled users to write a Chinese character directly on the device, since trackpads and touch screens were coming into use. .  But over time, these methods were slowly given up in favor of the much more efficient typing in smart keyboard apps like Sogou, which became the foundation of how Chinese people interact with technologies and each other.   .  They became a necessity for people's everyday lives—but this unfortunately opened everyone to a greater security risk. Even if more people knew about these vulnerabilities, it's hard to imagine Chinese users would ever ditch the apps; instead, maybe it's time users start demanding better security practices and more transparency from these companies.  .  (There are many more fascinating aspects to the historical relationship between the Chinese language and technology.

3,"Fewer providers means higher premiums to consumers, and the cost of reinsurance, which insurance companies purchase to limit their own exposure, has soared. That cost is also passed on to customers, further fueling the home insurance crisis.  ""The Florida market … has the characteristics that it should stabilize, but also it hasn't gotten better over the last 12 months,"" Larsen said.  ""A storm like Idalia exposes our vulnerabilities. It is an area that hasn't had a lot of strong events, which means its population of weakened homes is much higher.  ""If things remain as they are, the numbers of billion-dollar events will go up, because the population is increasing. The cost is very high. We have to start thinking about how we can mitigate these costs. How can we build stronger homes that are more resilient to these effects?. ""It starts with the same key themes we hear with climate, it's resilience and sustainability. If we want to aspire to a sustainable future we're going to have to start spending more time thinking about becoming more resilient."". In Miami Beach, renowned as ground zero of the climate emergency, city commissioners are spending millions of dollars to raise roadways and improve drainage to resist rising seas. Building code improvements in Florida and elsewhere means that new homes are more resilient to extreme weather events. But it all comes at a cost.  ""Evidence shows that climate change is impacting hurricane activity in the north Atlantic with a higher proportion of stronger, wetter hurricanes that have the potential to travel further inland before dissipating,"" CoreLogic's hurricane risk report says.  ""The combined effects of these factors could significantly impact US properties in future years, including structures once considered out of reach of hurricane wind and flooding.  ""Recent seasons have demonstrated that hurricane risk can, and likely will continue to, extend further inland, posing threats to millions more homes.",What factors contribute to the home insurance crisis in Florida?,"The home insurance crisis in Florida is contributed to by several factors. One factor is the decrease in the number of insurance providers, which leads to higher premiums for consumers. Additionally, the cost of reinsurance, which insurance companies purchase to limit their own exposure, has soared, and this cost is also passed on to customers. Another factor is the increased vulnerability of homes in Florida due to a lack of strong events in the area, resulting in a higher population of weakened homes. As a result, the number of billion-dollar events is expected to increase as the population in Florida grows. The excerpt also mentions the importance of building stronger and more resilient homes as a way to mitigate costs. Finally, the impact of climate change, including a higher proportion of stronger and wetter hurricanes, poses a significant threat to homes in Florida.

3,"Fifteen percent had anxiety disorders and 18 percent had significant depression. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that post-disaster health issues might vary from minor distress to severe mental health conditions. In Bangladesh, between 20-40 percent of those impacted experience mild psychological anguish, and between 50-60 percent face moderate to severe psychological distress.  Take the case of Moriyam Begum for example. The 45-year-old single mother of two and resident of Burigoalini union, has been collecting shrimp fries from gher (enclosures) and rivers for more than eight years. Before that, she was a labourer in a crop field nearby. Due to frequent cyclones and changing climate patterns, the field got contaminated with saline water, which made her unemployed. ""Following Cyclone Aila, I had no place for shelter after losing my house, possessions, and money. I again started from zero for the sake of my sons. My husband moved to Dhaka in search of work since all the fields were barren, and never returned."" She is now plagued with a reproductive illness as a result of spending at least five to six hours a day immersed in brackish water. Despite knowing about the health threats, she looked unwilling to leave this work.  According to the findings of a UNDP survey, women are more adversely impacted by natural disasters than men due to gender-based roles and responsibilities. Women who are responsible for taking care of their families confront additional issues, including higher workloads, water scarcity, food insecurity, and social insecurity, as many of their husbands move to the cities to earn a living. These additional social and cultural hurdles, induced by climate change, negatively affect mental health. On the other side, climate change also leads to men facing difficulties in ensuring livelihood and financial stability.  SAJIDA Foundation carried out pilot research in Gabura and Mongla, two southwestern areas that are frequently prone to natural catastrophes like cyclones, storms, floods and waterlogging. When asked whether natural disasters and climate change affect people's mental health, 88 percent of respondents said yes.",What percentage of respondents in the SAJIDA Foundation survey stated that natural disasters and climate change affect people's mental health?,"In the SAJIDA Foundation survey, 88 percent of the respondents stated that natural disasters and climate change affect people's mental health.

3,"And China's commerce ministry hailed the lifting of U.S. export restrictions on 27 entities as ""in line with the common interests of both sides."". Hedge fund manager Stephen Jen at Eurizon SLJ thinks the idea of complete decoupling is riven with problems and has to be 'calibrated' - issues related to high tech and privacy concerns may be a red line but China would continue to produce goods to sate U.S. demand and hold U.S. debt.  ""The symbiotic relationship between the U.S. and China was so critical in allowing the US to over-consume and China to run excess savings,"" he said. ""It will need to continue to be the case - otherwise U.S. (borrowing) rates would rise."". And this goes to the heart of the U.S. problem Summers has routinely pointed out about rising Treasury debt - which, exaggerated by the pandemic, has more than doubled to more than $25 trillion over the past decade and has more than doubled as a share of annual output over 20 years.  And yet China appears to have been backing away for years.  Having stopped accumulating outright dollar reserves over the past 12 years to funnel its surpluses into its 'Belt and Road' trade initiative and state bank deposits instead, China's share of outstanding U.S. Treasuries has been falling rapidly.  While Beijing has at least partly offset that by loading up on other U.S.-dollar bonds and mortgage debt, the share of foreign Treasury holdings held by Chinese and Hong Kong entities has more than halved to less than 14% from a high watermark of more than 30% 12 years ago.  Like much else in the bilateral financial bind, the dependency seems much reduced. And yet any shift in fragile financial markets may pack a punch for both sides equally and political signalling from here may prove as important as any real action in the background.  The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.","What is the relationship between the US and China in terms of trade and US Treasury debt, and how might it impact borrowing rates and financial markets?","The relationship between the US and China in terms of trade and US Treasury debt is described as symbiotic. China produces goods to meet US demand and holds a significant amount of US debt. This relationship has allowed the US to over-consume and China to accumulate excess savings. If this relationship were to change or decouple, borrowing rates in the US could rise. The US has a significant amount of Treasury debt, which has more than doubled over the past decade. However, China's share of US Treasury holdings has been falling rapidly in recent years. While China has diversified its holdings by investing in other US-dollar bonds and mortgage debt, the overall dependency on China has reduced. Any significant shift in this relationship could have implications for both countries and financial markets.",8f651a5a90e0e468492976503e12fcb6

But there are -- there will be contrasts, and I think Donald Trump will have a hard time resisting returning to try to offer a knockout punch as he sees it.  AVLON: Yeah.

John, let me get you to respond to what CNN is reporting on the fallout, continued fallout from super PAC backing DeSantis, sharing debate strategy memos on line that call for DeSantis to, quote, hammer Ramaswamy and defend Donald Trump.  Let me read this, one person close to DeSantis' political operation was surprised that a person that never backed down would even write a memo or think it was appropriate to give the campaign advice a week out from the debate. The response this person received from Republican donors on Thursday was a, quote, chorus of people who think it was dumb, they said.  How bad was this for the DeSantis campaign?. AVLON: I mean, it is yet another face plant in a campaign of face plants. It's a self-inflicted wound. You got to love the irony of the PAC being called Never Back Down. The advice is we'll back down when it comes to Donald Trump. You know, try to deflect that and defend rather than, you know, speaking with authenticity.  [16:55:04] And, of course, among the many problems this is is that we're all going to have a Ron DeSantis bingo card on debate night figuring out how many times he checks the boxes according to what was recommended.

And you know what else they don't work romantically, OK.

For example, here's a girl with a mask, OK, but here she is without it. Just saying.  Yet Lions Gate Studios in Hollywood recently forced its employees to mask up against the Wuhan Coronavirus. Now that one shouldn't surprise us because Hollywood has always been scared to stand up to China. But it's not just them.

3,"OPEC+ cuts to tighten oil market sharply in fourth quarter, IEA says. LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Oil output cuts which Saudi Arabia and Russia have extended to the end of 2023 will mean a substantial market deficit through the fourth quarter, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday, as it largely stuck by its estimates for demand growth this year and next.  OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, began limiting supplies in 2022 to bolster the market. This month, benchmark Brent crude breached $90 a barrel for the first time this year after OPEC+ leaders Saudi Arabia and Russia extended their combined 1.3 million barrel per day (bpd) cuts until the end of 2023.  Output curbs by OPEC+ members of more than 2.5 million bpd since the start of 2023 have so far been offset by higher supplies from producers outside the alliance, including the United States, Brazil and still under-sanctions Iran, the agency said.  ""But from September onwards, the loss of OPEC+ production... will drive a significant supply shortfall through the fourth quarter,"" it said in its monthly oil report.  However, the lack of cuts at the start of next year would shift the balance to a surplus, the agency said, highlighting that stocks will be at uncomfortably low levels, increasing the risk of another surge in volatility in a fragile economic environment.  Broader economic concerns, led by China's sluggish post-pandemic recovery, have been amplified by worries that interest rates will remain high in the United States.  Still, oil demand at the world's biggest oil importer has so ""far remained remarkably unaffected by its economic downturn"", the IEA said.  ""China is the main wild card,"" it added. ""Any abrupt weakening of China's industrial activity and oil demand is likely to spill over globally, making for a more challenging climate for emerging markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America."". Estimates of global demand and supply this year and next differ markedly depending on the forecaster.","What is the impact of OPEC+ cuts on the oil market, and what are the potential consequences of a lack of cuts in the start of next year?","The impact of the OPEC+ cuts, which Saudi Arabia and Russia have extended until the end of 2023, will result in a substantial market deficit in the fourth quarter, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). These output curbs have been offset by higher supplies from non-OPEC+ producers so far, but from September onwards, the loss of OPEC+ production will lead to a significant supply shortfall in the fourth quarter.

9,"Lessons from the holder of 10pc of the world's assets. Chanticleer. It is easy to see where the money is going when you have a direct line of sight on $US40 trillion in cash, bonds and equities.  It is risk-on in financial markets and has been that way since the start of July.  How do we know? Well, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and the United States' S&P 500 went up in July and equities are generally the best telltale indicator of risk taking in financial markets.  But the Australian and US indices are each down a few per cent since the start of August. So, is it still risk on?. Yes, according to State Street Global vice chairman and chief financial officer Eric Aboaf, who has a secret weapon that should give him a better read on the market than just about anyone worldwide.  Aboaf's weapon is his client base. State Street holds about 10 per cent of the world's financial assets worth $US40 trillion ($62.4 trillion) in its custody business on behalf of asset managers and asset owners, such as superannuation and sovereign wealth funds.  It tracks its custody clients' flows and holdings across the major asset classes (cash, equities, bonds), and can see where 10 per cent of the world's financial assets are moving on any day, week, or month. It also produces a flow index that is more of a risk appetite indicator and based on trading activity.  So, it is about following the money. And where is the money going? Into equities (risk).  Aboaf says cash holdings went down in July for the first time since March – the month when a handful of bank collapses including Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse's merger with UBS put the frights through investors. The movement was a bit more than one percentage point, which does not sound like a lot but is actually a huge amount of money when you consider that the survey base is $US40 trillion. Bond holdings were also lower.","Based on the excerpt, the question could be:

According to State Street Global's tracking of client flows and holdings, where has the money been moving in financial markets recently?","According to State Street Global's tracking of client flows and holdings, the money has been moving into equities (risk) in financial markets recently. This is indicated by the decrease in cash holdings in July, the first decrease since March, as well as the lower bond holdings.

A blast of late summer heat caused disruptions Wednesday for schools from Michigan to Virginia, with some districts dismissing students early and others holding classes online just days into the new academic year.  While temperatures weren't as high as last month's triple-digit deadly heat wave, schools in states including Michigan, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey cited inadequate air conditioning in cutting days short. One Massachusetts district canceled two days of classes because of hot classrooms. Temperatures in the mid-90s also led to online learning in Pittsburgh and Baltimore.  Only 20% of public schools in Detroit, where the temperature reached 89 degrees Tuesday but dropped Wednesday, have air conditioning. The district dismissed its roughly 54,000 students three hours early Wednesday for the second consecutive day.  ""We never want to inconvenience our families with early releases, but we also do not want our staff and students to be so uncomfortable that teaching and learning becomes a distraction to the heat,"" Detroit Public Schools Community District spokeswoman Chrystal Wilson said in a statement.  The early dismissals caused headaches for families who had to scramble to make last-minute schedule changes.  Parent Natesha Myers, who works from home, opted to keep her 5-year-old daughter with her. Myers said she would not have been able to pick her daughter up from her Detroit school three hours early because of scheduled work meetings.  ""It was very difficult and stressful,"" Myers said. ""I had to give her the iPad. She kept trying to climb on my lap."". Late summer heat isn't unusual. But temperatures at the start of the school year have been getting warmer for years.  For instance, Philadelphia's expected high of 95 on Wednesday is 13 degrees higher than the normal high for the day, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data. The holiday weekend also followed the hottest August scientists have ever recorded with modern equipment; scientists blame human-caused climate change.

Like his low marks for economic stewardship despite presiding over a robust recovery from the pandemic. The fact that significantly more Americans fret about his mental acuity than that of the unhinged Donald Trump.

Opinion Columnist. Jackie Calmes. Jackie Calmes brings a critical eye to the national political scene. She has decades of experience covering the White House and Congress.  But here's what is not unfair: that Biden is paying a political price in the polls for the legal travails of his son Hunter.  Yes, Trump and his Republican puppets in Congress are shameful for their nonstop investigating, reckless exaggeration and outright lies about Hunter Biden's exploiting the family name for business deals while Dad was the vice president, and for baselessly implicating Joe Biden.  House Republicans are shameless in undermining and attacking the federal prosecutor (a Trump appointee) whose job it has been for five years to investigate Hunter Biden. And they're irresponsible and politically stupid for moving toward impeaching the president, apparently for guilt by association given the lack of actual evidence — all to distract from, and draw false parallels with, the very real criminal charges and mountainous evidence against Trump.

Additionally, they have moved towards impeaching President Biden, using guilt by association and false parallels with the criminal charges against Trump as distractions. These tactics aim to undermine Joe Biden's credibility and reputation.",55e269aed0875086c320c290f6cba5db

9,"Coal spree continues with over 300 plants in queue. China has continued a coal spree that started last summer, ­approving more permits for new coal plants, commissioning newly built plants and even ­bringing long-dormant plants back online despite the approaching 2030 deadline for the nation to reach peak carbon emissions, according to new research.   The country approved permits for 52 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power capacity in the first half of this year, maintaining the previous pace of approving two plants per week, according to a report published by Global Energy Monitor (GEM) and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). China also doubled its commissioning of coal plants year on year, plugging 17.1GW into the grid in the first half of the year, according to the report.   The report said most new coal projects were in locations where there was no need for new coal capacity to support grid stability or the integration of ­variable sources of renewable power such as solar and wind - reasons Beijing had cited for its continuing build-up of coal capacity.  ""As the world turns its back on new coal projects, China is making the path towards its energy transition and climate commitments more complicated and costly,"" said Flora Champenois, research analyst at GEM and co-author of the report.   The excessive permitting of new coal capacity also points to a lack of enforcement of the government policies that are meant to keep the country on track to reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, according to analysts. China now relies on coal for more than half of its power generation.  From January to June, construction started on 37GW of new coal power capacity, while another 41GW of new projects were either announced or in the queue for government approval. Meanwhile, China for the first time restarted suspended projects, reviving 8GW of previously shelved coal capacity in the first half of the year, the report said.  The country has 243GW of new coal power plants under construction or permitted after the spree started last summer amid a widespread power shortage.",What actions has China taken regarding coal power capacity despite its commitments to reduce carbon emissions?,"Despite its commitments to reduce carbon emissions, China has continued to approve permits for new coal power capacity and has even brought long-dormant plants back online. In the first half of this year alone, China approved permits for 52 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power capacity and commissioned 17.1GW of coal plants. Additionally, construction started on 37GW of new coal power capacity and there are another 41GW of new projects in the queue for government approval.

Nic's report on Turkey is in the same category. But when you're talking about leaders going by armored train to meet in Vladivostok to exchange on one hand Kim Jong-un giving Putin artillery weapons, artillery ammunition, and potentially getting back ballistic missile capabilities from Russia for his programs, you're just seeing two leaders who only are allied with one another right now, and they're having more and more problems with executing their foreign policy.  So, it will generate a lot of discussion. There are also indicators that Russia and North Korea want to do exercises and training events. That would be an interesting thing to watch.

9,"""Everything related to fitness or unfitness for military service must be as clear as possible so that a person understands how he or she can help the defence, and so that the units have clarity on who will be joining them,"" he said.  Since Russia's invasion in 2021, all Ukrainian men aged 18-60 who are deemed fit for military service are restricted from leaving the country – with some exceptions – and can be called up to join the war effort.  Earlier this month, Zelenskyy fired all the heads of Ukraine's regional army recruitment centres in a sweeping anticorruption move.  Zelenskky said at the time that an investigation had exposed abuses by recruitment centre officials ranging from illegal enrichment to transporting men who were eligible for military duty over the country's border despite a wartime ban on international travel for those eligible for service.  The issue of corruption in Ukraine's military recruitment was exposed in June when a media investigation reported on the family wealth of Odesa's regional draft commissar Yevhen Borysov. The investigation reported on millions of dollars worth of real estate and luxury vehicles allegedly owned by Borysov's family members in Spain.  According to local media reports, Borysov was charged with ""unlawful enrichment"". Borysov denied all wrongdoing, saying he had nothing to do with his family's wealth.  Zelenskyy has made a crackdown on corruption in the military draft process a priority as his forces press on with a counteroffensive 18 months into Russia's invasion.

Kim, for his part, is eyeing Russian military technology including spy satellites and nuclear submarine expertise, along with food aid deeply needed in North Korea.  Russia is less concerned about the ramifications than ever in the past. While Russia was a signatory to the sanctions that prevent North Korea from conducting arms deals, it could now cancel those, Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said this week.  ""Why shouldn't we go back to the USSR model and be friends with North Korea?"" asked Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Moscow political analyst in international relations, in an interview with the Moskovsky Komsomolets paper earlier this week.

""I mean, you can't really say exactly what you're going to do,"" Trump told Welker, according to NBC. ""But I would say certain things to Putin. I would say certain things to Zelenskiy."". Welker noted to Trump that Russian bombs had destroyed maternity wards, and forces under Putin's command had deliberately attacked civilians. Furthermore, the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague in March issued an arrest warrant for Putin, accusing him of war crimes in connection with the abduction of Ukrainian children.  ""It's all terrible,"" Trump told Welker.  Trump has been facing more than 90 criminal charges across four separate indictments charging him with subversion of the 2020 election that he lost to his Democratic rival Joe Biden, retention of classified information after his presidency, and hush-money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.

9,"The deep here is simply called ""the Area"" by lawyers. Covering just over half the Earth's entire seabed, it's considered the common heritage of mankind, akin to the moon and outer space.  That means the profits from any riches beneath the waves are meant to be ""for the benefit of all"", as set out in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The convention created the International Seabed Authority (ISA), set up in 1994, to govern deep sea mining in the Area and divvy up profits fairly among nations. Commercial mining is not yet allowed, with country delegates still negotiating a mining code. But the ISA grants exploratory licences to countries, and to companies sponsored by governments, to prospect metal reserves, at half a million US dollars a pop.  More than 1.5 million square kilometres of international seabed, roughly the size of Mongolia, already falls under these licences, mostly in the CCZ. That zone also happens to be teeming with life. Drazen, who has visited the CCZ many times, describes dumbo octopuses with big, ""ear-like"" fins and ""gummy squirrel"" sea cucumbers that look like rubber sneakers.  A gummy squirrel in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone of the Pacific. Credit: DeepCCZ Expedition. Some small Pacific nations such as Nauru and the Cook Islands, which sponsor companies that have licences in the CCZ, argue the billions of dollars in metals beneath the waves could help lift their countries out of poverty. But others, including Fiji, Palau and Samoa, have called for a ban, worried that mining the deep could imperil the fish and sharks in higher water the countries rely on.  Long negotiations over seabed mining are coming to a head. In 2021, Nauru triggered an obscure rule giving the ISA a two-year deadline to finalise its mining code. That deadline expired in July, meaning the ISA's powerful operational arm, the Legal and Technical Commission, can now consider and approve commercial mining licences, whether global rules are in place or not.",What are the arguments for and against deep-sea mining in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) and how is the International Seabed Authority (ISA) involved in the decision-making process?,"The arguments for deep-sea mining in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) include the potential economic benefits for countries like Nauru and the Cook Islands, which sponsor companies with licenses in the area. These countries argue that the billions of dollars in metals beneath the waves could help alleviate poverty. On the other hand, countries like Fiji, Palau, and Samoa have called for a ban on deep-sea mining due to concerns about the impact on marine life, including fish and sharks that these countries heavily rely on. 

The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is involved in the decision-making process for deep-sea mining. The ISA, established in 1994, governs deep-sea mining in the Area, which includes the CCZ.

9,"The Staggering Economic Impact of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. You don't have to be a Swiftie to have been touched in some way by Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, a stadium arena experience that kicked off in March. The tour, which pays homage to every era of the artist's illustrious 17-year career, is set to become the biggest tour of all time only a third of the way through its run.  If you live in one of the 20 locales Swift, 33, performed at in the last five months, your city has likely seen a boost in revenue from the hundreds of thousands of attendees who traveled from near and far. If you don't—or simply couldn't snag tickets due to the cost or the now infamous Ticketmaster snafu—chances are you've seen clips of the three-and-a-half hour show from celebrities' Instagram stories. . While there's much to say about the music, costumes, and production, the impact of the Eras Tour is starkly reflected in the numbers: a projected gross of $2.2 billion in North American ticket sales alone, and hundreds of millions of streams, reaching a nearly 80% spike in those listening to her music catalog in the weeks after the tour kicked off. . After 53 shows, the first U.S. leg of the tour came to a close on Aug. 9. Swift originally announced 27 shows and has since extended the tour, adding new dates in cities like New Orleans, Indianapolis, and Toronto, which are all now anticipating a local economic boost. Eras is set to go international this month, starting with four shows in Mexico City, continuing its five-continent run through November 2024.  Swift's tour is in a league of its own, even among legendary groups like the Rolling Stones who have been touring for decades, other major touring artists like Harry Styles and Beyoncé and contemporaries like Adele with sold-out Las Vegas residencies, as the singer-songwriter brings her mega tour directly to her dedicated fans in various cities for multiple nights.

9,"Estonia PM under pressure over husband's alleged Russia business links. Reports claim firm partly owned by Kaja Kallas's husband has carried on working in Russia since Ukraine war. The Estonian prime minister is under mounting pressure over claims her husband has maintained business interests in Russia that the country's president, Alar Karis, has said have put ""the credibility of the Estonian state into question"".  Reports emerged last week that Stark Logistics, a company partly owned by Kaja Kallas's husband, Arvo Hallik, has continued to do business in Russia since the invasion of Ukraine last year.  Kallas and Hallik maintain that the business was assisting another Estonian company, Metaprint, to wrap up trade in Russia.  Local media have reported that Metaprint sold €17m worth of goods to Russia between the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the following November.  The prime minister – a vocal supporter of Ukraine against Russia – refused to attend a select committee scheduled on Monday, where she was expected to discuss presidential office funding. There is uncertainty as to whether Kallas will attend an anti-corruption select committee sitting on Tuesday, discussing continuing business activities in Russia during the conflict in Ukraine.  The budget committee chair, Urmas Reinsalu of the opposition party Isamaa, described Kallas's behaviour as unprecedented and called for her resignation.  ""A government leader lacking in moral capital is also a security threat, undermining our international credibility with regard to a resolute sanctions policy and continuing support for Ukraine,"" said Reinsalu.  Kallas, a former lawyer and the daughter of Estonia's former prime minister Siim Kallas, is credited with boosting the Baltic nation's growing international prowess, and publicly chided the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for picking up the phone to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in the early days of the war.  The claims are in stark contrast to Estonia's fervent backing of Ukraine's fight against Russia and Kallas's advocacy of sanctions against the Kremlin, urging Europe to cut its Russian energy dependency.  Estonia is among the biggest donors of military, humanitarian and economic aid to Ukraine per capita, despite facing inflation of up to 25%.",Why is the Estonian prime minister facing pressure over her husband's alleged business links to Russia?,"The Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, is facing pressure over her husband's alleged business links to Russia because it raises concerns about conflicts of interest and the credibility of the Estonian state.

9,"How China's clean power biz, tech are changing world. By Zheng Xin | China Daily | Updated: 2023-09-18 08:53. Not many might know, but Chinese energy companies, armed with unparalleled expertise in technologies and sophisticated equipment, have been expanding their green presence on the global stage in recent years.  Their impact ranges from the Belo Monte power transmission projects - the first ""power express"" in South America that has solved local power shortage - built by State Grid Corp of China, to the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant in Pakistan, which uses Hualong One, China's third-generation nuclear power technology with full intellectual property rights.  Ever since China ceased building coal-fired power projects overseas in 2021, the green trend has accelerated, with the country's major power companies making active adjustments, shifting their focus to green investments.  Many domestic energy and power companies are increasingly focusing on renewable energy projects such as solar and wind power globally, with the number of new energy projects invested by Chinese power companies last year rising nearly 56 percent year-on-year, covering regions such as Southeast Asia, Europe, Oceania and Latin America, according to the China Electricity Council.  The Belt and Road Initiative has been playing a significant role in driving the green trend of Chinese power companies in the global market of late, it said.  The conclusion is echoed by the China Electric Power Planning &Engineering Institute, saying energy cooperation accounts for around 40 percent of the total investment in countries and regions participating in the BRI, while the power sector itself accounts for half of the energy investment.  This has not only promoted the sharing and exchange of clean energy resources, but supported the development and utilization of renewable energy on a regional scale.  As I see it, Chinese companies are already playing a key role, injecting strong momentum into local economic and social sustainable development. They, however, are still at the middle and lower segments of the international industrial chain, with relatively low overall project profit.",How has China's shift towards green investments and renewable energy projects impacted global markets and sustainable development?,"China's shift towards green investments and renewable energy projects has had a significant impact on global markets and sustainable development.

But when you think about it, though, China does have a stake here, because as you know, it's long been North Korea's biggest supporter and providing the Pyongyang regime with an economic lifeline.  And from Kim's perspective, that's probably why he wants to have more options, and Russia now becomes one such natural choice. And for Putin, of course, his top priority now is to winning in the war in Ukraine, which has become an organizing principle and its foreign policy. And given what North Korea has, despite its small size and collapse economy, it does boasts one of the world's biggest standing armies and military production capacity.  So all of those 10s of millions of ammunition becomes very alluring to Putin, so that is why you know, this embrace between the two leaders we've been talking about. But China so far has not said much publicly about the developments in the Russian Far East, rather than saying both countries are China's friendly neighbors and China still maintains very strong ties with both but I think from for Putin and Kim, they are definitely keenly aware of this balancing act that they need to maintain to not to cross Beijing, John.

9,"The tongue-in-cheek hypothesis stipulated that two countries that were sufficiently developed to support a McDonald's would not fight each other. Russian President Vladimir Putin, among others, later proved him wrong.  Even as advocates of globalisation celebrated, interconnected systems became a theatre for bitter battles. Perhaps most significantly, the U.S. government realised it could use the internet to spy on adversaries and the financial system to subdue them.  U.S. online dominance enabled it to eavesdrop on phone calls and emails from around the world, a process that went largely undetected until the National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden blew the whistle in 2013. Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury realised it could exclude enemies such as North Korea and Iran from the global dollar-based payments system, while forcing financial institutions in other countries to enforce its policies.  Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman vividly describe this shift in ""Underground Empire: How America Weaponized the Global Economy"". The authors, respectively professors at Johns Hopkins SAIS and Georgetown University, explain how the unseen network of computer protocols and undersea cables was not built deliberately as a tool of state power. Indeed, U.S. officials were initially reluctant to exert their authority over foreign banks and fund managers. But the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, just three months before China formally joined the WTO, amplified the urgency of pursuing America's enemies.  The phenomenon the authors call ""weaponized interdependence"" has expanded ever since. Years before the Chinese government expressed doubts about iPhones, the United States used financial and technological sanctions to attack Huawei, the Chinese maker of telecommunications equipment. U.S. regulators imposed a huge fine on BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), the French bank, for circumventing sanctions on Sudan, Iran and Cuba. When Putin invaded Ukraine, America and its allies initiated a huge barrage of penalties, kicked most Russian banks out of the SWIFT payments network, and opened a new front by freezing a large chunk of Moscow's central bank reserves.  More recently, the Biden Administration has imposed controls on technology exports to prevent China from developing sophisticated semiconductors. Far from escaping the clutches of government control, ""U.S.",How has the United States used its online dominance and financial system to exert power over its adversaries?,"The United States has used its online dominance and financial system to exert power over its adversaries by utilizing surveillance and sanctions. The U.S. government has used its online dominance to eavesdrop on phone calls and emails worldwide, which was largely unknown until Edward Snowden revealed it in 2013. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury has excluded countries like North Korea and Iran from the global dollar-based payments system and forced financial institutions in other countries to enforce its policies. This is demonstrated through the example of the U.S. imposing sanctions on Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications equipment maker, and initiating penalties and freezing assets in response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

ROMO: Thyden says that it was all a scheme to make money out of unsuspecting foreign families looking to adopt children, especially Americans who had no idea what was going on.  Your adoptive family in the United States had no idea that you had been stolen as a baby?. THYDEN: They never believed for one second that they were buying a child. They never would've done that.  ROMO: During the dictatorship of General Agusto Pinochet in the 1970s and 80s, babies were funneled to adoption agencies, some from the upper classes, taken, or given up to protect reputations of their mothers and some from the lower classes where children were simply stolen.  Chilean authorities say many priests, nuns, doctors, nurses and others conspired to carry out illegal adoptions.  Authorities told us the number of stolen babies could be in the thousands. But the investigation into the adoptions has languished over the years as some of the hospitals where the children were born have shut down as we have found out over the years.  [01:49:53]. ROMO: For many women, in this country, what this hospital in ruins means is a place where their children were stolen, a place that became a nightmare for them.  They were looking for a place where they would deliver a healthy baby. Instead, they left empty-handed.

Crist later said that the image of him and Obama embracing was used by his political opponents to paint him as insufficiently conservative. He has since lost three statewide races, including last year's nearly 19-point defeat to DeSantis.  Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who is running for the GOP presidential nomination, still faces attacks from Republican rivals for welcoming Obama to New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy devastated his state in 2012. Images of Christie and Obama embracing circulated, and his Republican opponents accused him of boosting the Democratic president ahead of the 2012 election.  Christie later said he met with Obama because he needed federal help for his state after the deadly storm, but the criticism has been sustained. Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy brought up the decade-old meeting during last month's GOP presidential debate, saying Christie's support helped elect Obama to a second term.  During the debate, DeSantis blasted Biden's response to the Maui fires that killed more than 100 people last month. Biden, who was on vacation as the toll of the crisis became clear, waited more than 10 days to visit Maui. White House officials said he coordinated with the state's governor to ensure the trip would not impact the recovery.

9,"SIYABONGA HADEBE: Brics and multipolarity: a polar with a begging bowl. Africa needs to focus on developing its own economy and building its own institutions. The 15th Brics summit ended on August 24 after six new countries were admitted to the fold. After long periods of speculation about ""disagreements"" over welcoming new members, outgoing Brics chair Cyril Ramaphosa laid the issue to rest. From January 1 2024, Brics will add Argentina, Ethiopia, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Local and foreign media hailed this development as the strengthening of a ""multipolar world order"".  Without many people being aware, the vocabulary of international politics is loaded with terminologies and phrases, the meanings of which are not quite known. These concepts are frequently used to the point that their supposed meanings appear normal, whereas their purpose has always been ""to impose a liberal globalised civilisation on the world today"". The rivalry between the West and Soviet Union gave rise to what was falsely referred to as the Cold War, a term that rings untrue in the contexts of Africa, Latin America and Asia, where its effect was far from cold.  Experts fervently talk about moving from a unipolar to a multipolar world, and the Brics expansion is interpreted using this fissured polarity lens. There is confusing excitement that the inclusion of the new members will create a multipolar world and that Brics will serve as a counterweight to Western hegemony. While many people in peripheral places (Africa included) yearn to break free from the influence of their former colonisers, the bipolar vs multipolar characterisation does not accurately reflect the complexities of their situation.  The important point that needs attention is that African scholars, politicians and the media frequently and recklessly use this phraseology without considering the implications. Their artificial interpretation of geopolitical developments inadvertently perpetuates what Singaporean diplomat Bilahari Kausikan terms a ""binary fallacy"". The problem lies in over-reliance on imported terminologies that are relevant for other places, but definitely not our troubled continent. .","What is the author's criticism of the terminology and phrases used in international politics, and how does the inclusion of new members in Brics relate to this critique?","The author criticizes the terminology and phrases used in international politics, arguing that they are loaded with meanings that may not accurately reflect the complexities of certain regions, such as Africa.

The inclusion of new members in Brics, seen as a move towards a multipolar world, is seen by the author as a misguided interpretation of geopolitical developments. The author suggests that African scholars, politicians, and media should be cautious in their use of such terminology, as it perpetuates a ""binary fallacy"" and may not accurately represent the unique challenges faced by the continent.",93491ae47c28218f0d191069a2026723

9,"UNSW's Dylan McConnell, who provided the chart below, says NSW prices have fallen sharply in the September quarter to date – to about $95 per megawatt hour, from $148MW/h in the June quarter. That's still the highest of the big states, but prices generally are at their lowest since before last year's grid crisis, and NSW prices have tended to spike with the best of them in the June quarter for a few years.  In other words, there's a lot going on in the grid and the Liddell effect may be less than stated – another good reason for any Eraring extension to be as limited as possible.  For example, an ""extension"" positioning Eraring as a reserve plant which sits out of the market – to be called on only in emergencies – wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing either for emissions or other (renewables) investment decisions, McConnell says.  At any rate, it looks like something that advocates for on-time closure – such as Climate Energy Finance's Tim Buckley, might have to wear. Even so, Buckley has a menu of ""no regrets"" investments in renewables that NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe and the NSW Treasurer Daniel Mookhey should consider regardless of Eraring.  They include: backing with front-loaded finance and accelerated planning approvals 1200MW of utility scale renewables and 1200MW of distributed (customer-owned) renewables each year until 2030; accelerating the rollout of rooftop solar and batteries in public housing and schools across NSW; accelerating the frequency and ambition of Renewable Energy Zones auctions; cajoling NSW transmission and distribution companies to use tech company Neara to identify existing spare grid capacity for new renewables to be plugged in (it reckons there's room for 10,000MW); and accelerating electrification for rentals and behind-the-meter batteries.  Buckley says the federal government should get behind all of the above and also lift the cap on the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme from 100kW to 1000kW to accelerate commercial and industrial (C&I) deployments, which have lagged.  These programs would cost money but have major benefits.","According to Tim Buckley, what are some ""no regrets"" investments that NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe and the NSW Treasurer Daniel Mookhey should consider regardless of the Eraring power plant?","According to Tim Buckley, some ""no regrets"" investments that NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe and the NSW Treasurer Daniel Mookhey should consider regardless of the Eraring power plant include backing utility scale renewables and distributed renewables, accelerating the rollout of rooftop solar and batteries in public housing and schools, accelerating Renewable Energy Zones auctions, utilizing Neara to identify spare grid capacity for new renewables, accelerating electrification for rentals and behind-the-meter batteries, and lifting the cap on the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme for commercial and industrial deployments.

9,"The second factor that I would like to say is that this has been changing in a very dramatic way because the more mature young voters are explaining to their younger [cohort] the real issues in the presidential election and they realise that there are several problems with Ko Wen-je and his [Taiwan People's Party or TPP]. If you look at polls, young people are fleeing from Ko Wen-je and the TPP.  Al Jazeera: China has been increasingly antagonistic towards Taiwan over the past year. Do you expect this to ramp up more as the election gets closer?. Joseph Wu: It's hard to say. Different people have different assessments but most people, or most analysts in Taiwan, understand that whenever China tries to interfere into our elections in a forceful way, it tends to backfire. It [test-fired missiles during] the first presidential election in 1996 and every time we go through the same cycle.  If the Chinese are interested in the election results here in Taiwan, I don't think that they will do anything as major as what we saw last August or this past April like large-scale military exercises. If the Chinese do that, I'm sure that people are going to look at China in a very negative way.  But if you look at the Chinese decision-making system, it's highly centralised. All the power is central to Xi Jinping. And of course, he is one man. He cannot have all the information he needs. If he makes a wrong judgement by thinking that maybe the election in Taiwan is not going in a way that the Chinese Communist Party would like, there's a possibility – or we don't rule out the possibility – that China may resort to military exercises or a military threat against Taiwan.  Other than the military, we should also look at other factors of how China is trying to shape the election result, for example, economic coercion and hybrid warfare.  They've been talking about ending the EFA – the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement – reached between Taiwan and China [in 2010]. They are also investigating some of Taiwan's exports to China and they may do something like ban our mangoes.  Hybrid warfare is something that we are watching very carefully.",What tactics is China using to try to shape the election results in Taiwan?,"China is using tactics such as economic coercion and hybrid warfare to shape the election results in Taiwan. Specifically, they have been threatening to end the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (EFA) between Taiwan and China and investigating Taiwanese exports, potentially leading to bans on certain products like mangoes. These economic measures are aimed at pressuring Taiwan and influencing the outcome of the election. Additionally, China may resort to military exercises or threats if they perceive that the election is not going in a way that the Chinese Communist Party desires.

9,"His team has developed a new tool that can measure the tiny heat flows that can help in detection of these particles.  CHEMICAL SCIENCES. . AT Biju. Department of Organic Chemistry, IISc, Bengaluru. Biju has been recognised for using new environment-friendly methods to synthesise biologically important compounds that have implications in the development of new drug-like molecules.  Transition metals like iron, copper, silver and gold have traditionally been used as catalysts in many chemical reactions. But transition metals are toxic, leave a significant environmental footprint and are costly. New methods of carrying out chemical reactions that do not rely on transition metals as catalysts, and yet are more efficient and environment-friendly have been developed. These methods are increasingly being deployed, particularly in synthesis of carbon compounds.  AT Biju. Biju's group has used such unconventional transition metal-free approaches to create carbon compounds that open new avenues for the synthesis of drug-like molecules.  Debabrata Maiti. Department of Chemistry, IIT-Bombay. Debabrata has been working on a problem similar to the one that is engaging Biju, but uses a slightly different approach to make his chemical reactions more efficient. Debabrata's group has stuck with transition metals, but added a new class of molecules, called ligands, to get their desired outcome.  Debabrata Maiti. Organic chemistry is all about breaking carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds and substituting them with other molecules to make new desired compounds. The effort is to make harder-to-access chemicals using easily available starting materials with the shortest possible number of steps. Debabrata has been working on efficiently activating C-H bonds at specific locations so that they can be broken easily and substituted with other molecules. He has been using transition metals like palladium, cobalt or nickel as catalysts.","What are the advantages of using unconventional transition metal-free approaches in the synthesis of carbon compounds, as mentioned by AT Biju in the excerpt?","According to AT Biju, using unconventional transition metal-free approaches in the synthesis of carbon compounds offers several advantages. Firstly, it eliminates the use of transition metals like iron, copper, silver, and gold, which are toxic, environmentally harmful, and costly. This allows for more environmentally-friendly and cost-effective chemical reactions. Additionally, these methods are more efficient and open up new avenues for the synthesis of drug-like molecules. Biju's group has successfully used these approaches to create carbon compounds that have implications in the development of new drug-like molecules.

Who's benefiting? The Preqin report specifically calls out KKR, Thoma Bravo, Brookfield Asset Management, ICG, and Advent International—all of whom name pension plans as some of their largest investors.  2. The East Coast is the new king of early-stage deals. In 2022, there were more early-stage deals in New York City than in San Francisco for the first time, according to Preqin data. While NYC may still lag in the later stages, New York, Los Angeles, and Toronto are all becoming bigger players in the early rounds. ""This should over time translate into a greater share of late-stage deals being sourced outside San Francisco,"" according to Preqin.  3. Thoma Bravo is leading the pack on A.I. deals. Thoma Bravo, Vista Equity Partners, and New Mountain Capital are some of the managers scooping up shares of A.I. companies, with A.I. investments making up at least 6% of their total deals, according to Preqin. . Blackstone Group has invested a whopping $56.8 billion in A.I.-focused deals—the most in aggregate among North American managers—though it's a smaller percentage of its overall deal flow than some of the other players. . 4.

9,"The way ahead for fishery cooperation in the South China Sea. Fishery stocks are resources of wildlife with limited capacity of replenishment. The sustainable use of these resources requires management regimes to be science-based and well enforced, and uncertainties should be taken into account. Generally, international law including UNCLOS has provided legal basis for such cooperation. Among them, one is that states bordering an enclosed or semi-enclosed sea should cooperate with each other in the exercise of their rights and in the performance of their duties to coordinate the management, conservation, exploration and exploitation of the living resources of the sea. Another is that before maritime delimitation disputes have been settled, the states concerned, in a spirit of understanding and cooperation, shall make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature including joint development.  According to the estimates of the Food and Agriculture Organization, about 90 percent of the world's economic fish stocks have been overexploited, and the proportion of fish stocks at a biologically sustainable level has dropped from 90 percent to 65 percent in the past 50 years. More than a third of fish stocks are fished in unsustainable conditions. As one of the centers of marine biodiversity in the world, the South China Sea has a variety of typical ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, coastal wetlands. There are more than 970 species of macrobenthos and more than 2,300 species of fishery resources. The South China Sea is one of the five most productive fishing areas in the world, and marine fishery is an important industry in countries and regions around it. The fish catch in the South China Sea accounts for about 12 percent of the global total, and it is an important source of protein for about 300 million people in the coastal countries.  According to the estimates of the Chinese fishery departments, the density of fishery resources in the shallow sea area of the South China Sea in recent years is about 0.3 tons per square kilometer, which is only one-twentieth of the original resource density. The direct causes for the declining fish stocks are excessive fishing intensity and destructive fishing methods.",What are the main challenges facing fishery cooperation in the South China Sea and how do they relate to the declining fish stocks in the region?,"The main challenges facing fishery cooperation in the South China Sea relate to the declining fish stocks in the region.

One Swiftie who spoke with Insider called their ""Eras Tour"" trip ""a little bit concert, a little bit vacation."" My family and I agreed. When it came time to choose a summer vacation, instead of Disney or some tropical locale, we landed on LA for a second dose of ""The Eras Tour."". With the help of Swift's tour — and Beyoncé's ""Rennaisance World Tour,"" as well as the ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" movie premieres — we ended up in an economic era with a fitting nickname: ""Goldilocks."" That is, the economy this summer was not too hot, not too cold.  Bad news for the US economy. While many worried about an oncoming recession, consumer spending held up the economy this summer. But now, a recent survey from Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse found that 21% of more than 500 investors predicted that personal consumption would shrink in the fourth quarter. A further 56% said consumption would reverse in early 2024.  Pandemic-era savings are running dry with record levels of credit card debt, student-loan payments are resuming, and we are about to hit the window for the delayed impact of higher interest rates. All of that adds up to a perfect storm of pressure on American consumers.  Piper Sandler's Chief Global Economist, Nancy Lazar, recently warned that the economy was ""overheating"" and was about to get more ""painful."". ""Save your pennies because, unfortunately, the economic outlook is going to get worse before it gets better,"" Lazar told Fox News Digital, adding that it was ""a time to hunker down and to try to maintain your savings rather get further into debt."".

9,"Taking our ocean off the boil. Billions of people and economies are at risk. The ocean is warming, and here are three ways we can act now. In recent months, much of the world has suffered under scorching heatwaves — searing temperatures that aren't just felt on land; they are having a profound effect on the 70% of our Earth's surface that remains hidden for many: our ocean. This includes record-low sea ice and mass coral bleaching, both of which are impacting our delicate marine ecosystems.  What's at stake? Marine heatwaves, characterized byextended periods of anomalously warm sea surface temperatures, are currently off the charts, and the results have been immediate. Fish, which mirror the temperature of the water, are re-locating toward the colder climes in the poles in a bid to stay cool. The world's largest single-species fishery, the Peruvian anchovy fishery, closed in June due to the effects of El Niño, which brings warmer surface waters to the eastern Pacific Ocean. As climate change heats waters around countries such as New Zealand, food-gathering practices of Māori tribes, which have sustained communities for generations, are now threatened by the shrinking availability of food sources such as cockles and mussels.  The degradation of highly productive ecosystems like coral reefs is due to a range of factors, including ocean heating coupled with decades of overfishing, and it threatens to push the ocean to the point of no return, unable to deliver the services on which humanity depends. As a vital climate regulator, how can we make our ocean more resilient to climate change while also building the resilience of the communities that rely on it?. Without a sea-change in how we care for the ocean, we are risking the irreversible loss of marine life as well as life-changing effects for half the world that depends on fish for food and livelihoods. If more world leaders — convening at the UN General Assembly in New York — don't commit to work with nature, the cost of inaction, measured in lives, livelihoods, and dollars will be staggering.  Here are three ways that we, as a global community, can lead this change:.",What are the consequences of marine heatwaves on marine ecosystems and human communities?,"Marine heatwaves, caused by anomalously warm sea surface temperatures, have immediate consequences on marine ecosystems and human communities. One immediate consequence is the relocation of fish to colder areas, disrupting fishing industries and impacting the food supply for communities that rely on fish as a food source. Additionally, the degradation of highly productive ecosystems like coral reefs, which is exacerbated by ocean heating and overfishing, threatens the ocean's ability to provide essential services for humanity. This includes regulating climate and supporting livelihoods. Without significant action to address these consequences, there is a risk of irreversible loss of marine life and detrimental effects on the half of the world that depends on fish for both food and livelihoods. This highlights the urgent need for global leaders to commit to working with nature to improve the resilience of marine ecosystems and the communities that rely on them. The evidence supporting these consequences can be found in the excerpt, which mentions the relocation of fish due to warming waters and the threat to food sources for Māori tribes in New Zealand. The excerpt also discusses the degradation of coral reefs resulting from ocean heating and overfishing.",296e3321a12faa64ba2e657d9971c106
9,"Low liquidity in China's domestic economy and an ""urgent need to balance provincial debt"" in an uncertain post-coronavirus pandemic world also took a toll, she said.  Brazil's decline came as Argentina overtook its neighbour in the CBBC rankings for the first time and meant it was the top destination for Chinese investment in Latin America, according to the report.  Argentina edged Brazil by just US$40 million, boosted by its energy sector and lithium mining. Lithium, an essential component in batteries, is abundant in Argentine soil.  Yet the altered standings could prove temporary as Brazil looked likely to remain the region's primary destination for Chinese money, said Margaret Myers of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-headquartered think tank.    Argentina had a long history of deals, some of which may have only been completed in the last year and leading to the current showing, she added.  Myers hesitated to attribute Buenos Aires's figures to its joining the Belt and Road Initiative in 2022, saying that while some new business may have been solicited this did not mean Argentina had become more attractive than Brazil or that it was now a permanent investment destination for Beijing.  Instead, the changing nature of Chinese investment in Brazil could have been at play. Myers said Chinese investors were still interested in electricity generation and transmission worldwide.  ""But in Brazil, China already has such a pronounced presence in those sectors that, frankly, there's not a lot more to acquire.""  Cariello echoed that assessment, noting electric and new energy vehicles were an emerging sector and high priority for China. Beijing's global investment in electric cars surged by more than 40 per cent between 2016 and 2020, he said. In Brazil, the sector last year accounted for more than half of all greenfield investments.  5 trade moves China has made in 2023 in the US's backyard of Latin America  Two Chinese carmakers have led by example with their massive investments in Brazil.

The abundance of lithium in Argentine soil, which is an essential component in batteries, played a significant role in attracting Chinese investment. Additionally, Argentina's long history of deals and its recent participation in the Belt and Road Initiative may have contributed to its current showing.

Small modular reactors is where India is pushing for a global leadership slot, both as a way of fulfilling its commitment to the clean energy transition, and bundling SMRs as a technology-led foreign policy pitch at the upcoming G20 meet.  Across two key strategic sectors - nuclear generation and space technology - where participation from entities outside of the government has been limited so far, an upscaling of private sector interest is being attempted by, ironically, a scaling down of size.  In the civil nuclear sector, the Indian government is pushing Small Modular Reactors or SMR as a technology of promise that can help in industrial decarbonisation, including a determined hard sell of the country's ability to take a leadership role in the dissemination of this technology.  Likewise, the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) resolve to transfer its Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) to the private sector, after having conducted two development flights of the rocket, aims clearly at enabling private players to offer on-demand services to put satellites weighing up to 500 kg into a low-earth orbit as the government seeks more investment in the booming space market. India is aiming to increase its share of the global satellite launch market fivefold over the next decade and the SSLV is seen as the government-led launchpad for fostering private innovation.  But it is the small reactors where India is pushing for a global leadership slot, both as a way of fulfilling its commitment to clean energy transition, and bundling SMRs as a technology-led foreign policy pitch at the upcoming G20 meet.

Today, we take great pride in the fact that a million-strong Filipinos reside in the UAE, held in high esteem in the business, medical, construction, creative fields. The essence of the task of a diplomat is to build bridges of friendship and understanding between countries and peoples. I found, upon my arrival in January this year, that Filipinos have been successfully undertaking this task long before the first Filipino diplomat ever set foot in the UAE.  I say this as we mark today the 49th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Philippines and the UAE on August 19, 1974. The Philippines' first diplomatic mission was opened in Abu Dhabi on June 19, 1980 at the Al Ain Palace Hotel before it moved to Janana Building along Electra Street in Khalidiya Area, now the Philippine Embassy is located in Al Mushrif.  Moreover, I would not be surprised to learn that immediately after the Founding Father Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan established the seven emirates in 1971 into the United Arab Emirates we know today, Filipinos were already part of the first group of expatriates that came to the UAE's desert sands to help build the foundations of the cities of this country. They were among the first architects, builders and engineers to come to the UAE to build the first bridges and buildings of this young nation. Those Filipinos founded and cemented the strong ties between our two countries which have endured to this day.  The work that I and eight previous ambassadors before me have been doing, including countless diplomats these past 48 years, are indeed firmly founded on the strong friendship and solidarity between our Filipino compatriots with Emiratis and fellow expatriates in the UAE.

9,"That's why I'm sitting at my desk doing a little back-of-the-napkin math as I eat some chicken tortilla soup.  Let's look at the deal that almost was: A.I. computing company NVIDIA agreed to acquire Arm from SoftBank for about $40 billion three years ago. As we all know, regulatory challenges ended up dooming that deal, though NVIDIA still partners with Arm (and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang made appearances in Arm's roadshow video). If you look at the acquisition figure alone—$40 billion—it looks like SoftBank actually might make it out better with an Arm IPO. That's until you look at the terms.  NVIDIA had agreed to pay SoftBank $21.5 billion in NVIDIA common stock, plus $12 billion in cash, for Arm. There were also some other components to the deal, including an up-to $5 billion earn-out, granted Arm met specific targets, and $1.5 billion in equity to Arm employees. All of that rounded out to a $40 billion deal valuation.  Here's the breakdown of what, theoretically, could have ended up in SoftBank's pocket:. $12 billion    – cash $21.5 billion – common stock $5 billion      – earn-out cash or common stock (subject to hurdles) TOTAL: $38.5 billion. While it's fun to get all wrapped up in the big number here, the key is the performance of NVIDIA shares post-close. And, in hindsight, SoftBank could have really made out on that front if the deal had gone through and it chose to hold onto those shares for a bit. . NVIDIA shares were trading at more than $485 a pop by market close Tuesday, up from nearly $129 per share the day the NVIDIA-Arm deal was announced. That means they are now worth 277% more than they were the day the transaction was announced. Here's a chart, because this is pretty insane:. There's a lot of reasons for NVIDIA's explosive three years. An obvious one would be the generative A.I. boom, as NVIDIA is the main infrastructure supplier for A.I. systems. The company has repeatedly surpassed earnings expectations this year. .","What were the terms of the deal between NVIDIA and SoftBank for the acquisition of Arm, and how could SoftBank have potentially benefited if the deal had gone through?","The terms of the deal between NVIDIA and SoftBank for the acquisition of Arm included $12 billion in cash, $21.5 billion in NVIDIA common stock, up to $5 billion in earn-out cash or common stock (depending on meeting specific targets), and $1.5 billion in equity for Arm employees. If the deal had gone through and SoftBank had chosen to hold onto the NVIDIA shares, they could have potentially benefited from the increase in NVIDIA's stock price. As of the time of the article, NVIDIA shares were trading at over $485 per share, up from nearly $129 per share when the deal was announced, representing a 277% increase.",208a583ce9d14829ac376109b11b0cb9

What do you make of what's been causing a little bit of a bruhaha, because it's sort of exemplary of a certain tendency that the government's invitation to the dinner for the summit was identified not as India but as Bharat, which is an alternative name for India, recognized in the constitution but it's quite unusual to use it like that? Is it a deliberate signal?. BOBBY GHOSH, COLUMNIST, BLOOMBERG AND HINDUSTAN TIMES FORMER EDITOR-IN- EDITOR: Well, yes, it is part of Prime Minister Modi and his party's nationalist -- Hindu nationalist agenda. It's a little bit off a distraction from other problems that the country is facing, including quite serious levels of poverty despite the wealth that is on show during this conference, and also a sort of programs against minorities within India.  So, using the Bharat name is a way to distract attention. It is associated with the ruling party, of course, which is the Bharatiya Janata Party. There's an echo in the name. It's an historical name but it's not in common use international and frankly, even within India. So, this is a little bit of smoke and mirrors, look here, not there. That's what is being attempted.  AMANPOUR: It's really interesting, again, because it just says -- I think the whole thing that you're talking about puts into stark focus the maybe competing ideals of human rights and democracy versus real politics as, Richard Haass, you've laid out.

9,"The care segment will be moderated by Tamsin Greulich-Smith, the director of School of X at DesignSingapore Council who leads the organisation's transformation design programmes. Under discussion will be the multifaceted nature of care, from empowering individuals to take responsibility for their well-being and strengthening the community of care, to creating empathetic specialised care services and driving national-level policy to establish systems of care.  Speakers will include Dr Tom Waller, a sports, health and fitness innovator who founded Lululemon's Whitespace, the brand's lab for research and ideation, as well as Lee Poh Wah, CEO of the philanthropic Lien Foundation, which works to improve the lives of the underprivileged, the elderly and children with special needs.    One of the foundation's most successful projects is Hack Care, a collaboration with architects and furniture designers to develop a toolkit for carers of people with dementia, which received Singapore's President's Design Award in June. Presented in a catalogue format, it provides tips on modifying everyday items of furniture and home products so that caregivers can more easily accommodate the needs of dementia patients.  ""As our society ages, it is imperative to redefine the purpose, goals and values that underpin our healthcare system,"" Lee says. ""The future of healthcare is inherently social. It calls for a shift beyond institutional-based models to bring care into the community where seniors reside."" He notes that such an approach values trust and kindness, which are at the heart of positive health outcomes.  ""There is a role for design to help bridge the realms of health and social care,"" he adds. ""By designing for kindness, we can counter the mechanisation of healthcare and humanise the entire care system.""  The proliferation of emerging technologies has made us look again at our digital future. The forum will explore this topic in the emerging tech segment, moderated by Dr Ming Tan, the founding executive director of the Tech for Good Institute, a non-profit research hub.  Among those speaking will be Chng Kai Fong, managing director of Singapore's Smart Nation and Digital government office, who will discuss new digital solutions and the user experience for government services.","What is the purpose of the Hack Care collaboration between architects and furniture designers mentioned in the excerpt, and what recognition did it receive?",The purpose of the Hack Care collaboration mentioned in the excerpt is to develop a toolkit for caregivers of people with dementia. The collaboration involves architects and furniture designers working together to modify everyday furniture and home products to better accommodate the needs of dementia patients.

9,"Whichever Way the U.S. Pivots, China Is Already There | Opinion. It has often been argued that Washington's increased focus on a rising Chinese threat is distracting the United States from paying sufficient attention to other threats. America's ""pivot to Asia"" in response to China is seen as coming at the cost of pivots away from Europe and the Middle East—as European and Middle Eastern politicians and commentators have often expressed fears about.  Indeed, some Republican politicians and commentators in particular have argued that China has become such a threat that the U.S. should not give too much military assistance to Ukraine's effort to fend off Russia since the U.S. itself will need these weapons to deter or even combat China in Asia.  For someone like me who grew up during the Cold War, these lines of reasoning seem very odd. Back then, the Soviet Union was America's main adversary. Further, it was America's main adversary not just in those parts of Europe and Asia adjacent to the USSR, but throughout the world, including the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The U.S. faced other adversaries as well, but these—especially the numerous Marxist or other anti-Western governments and revolutionary movements in many countries—were usually supported by Moscow.  Xi Jinping Ron Sachs-Pool/. Similarly in the present era, Sino-American rivalry is not just occurring in countries and seas adjacent to China, but throughout the world. China has been actively seeking to expand its influence throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, the Pacific, and even Europe. The U.S., of course, has other adversaries, but some of these are linked, even if not formally allied, to China. Trade with China has provided an economic lifeline to three U.S. adversaries in particular: Russia, Iran, and North Korea. China is not supporting revolutionary movements now like the Soviet Union (and Mao's China) did during the Cold War. But perhaps even more challenging for Washington, China has such strong economic ties with America's allies across the globe that many of them are reluctant to harm them by supporting U.S. sanctions or trade tariffs against Beijing.",How does the increased focus on the Chinese threat affect the United States' attention to other threats and regions?,"The increased focus on the Chinese threat, often referred to as the ""pivot to Asia,"" is seen as diverting the United States' attention away from other threats and regions, specifically Europe and the Middle East. Some politicians and commentators argue that the U.S. should prioritize military assistance to Ukraine in its efforts to fend off Russia, but others believe these weapons may be necessary to deter or combat China in Asia. This shift in focus is causing concerns among European and Middle Eastern politicians. As stated in the excerpt, during the Cold War, the United States considered the Soviet Union its main adversary and had to address its presence and influence worldwide. Similarly, the Sino-American rivalry is not limited to countries and seas adjacent to China but extends throughout the world, with China actively seeking to expand its influence globally. Additionally, China's economic ties with U.S. allies make it challenging for these countries to support U.S. sanctions or trade tariffs against Beijing.",0c8be8dd21a3331cb619f9d64bf1a6dc
9,"BLACKWELL: Eva McKend, thank you so much.  WALKER: All right, so the price of buying a home just got more expensive as the Federal Reserve's historic rate hiking campaign continues. Will we see another rate hike before the end of the year?. (COMMERCIAL BREAK). [07:27:43]. BLACKWELL: The U.S. mortgage rate surged this week to their highest level in 21 years. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averages 7.09 percent. That's the highest it's been since April 2002 when it was 7.13 percent. Jeana Smialek is New York Times Federal Reserve and Economy Reporter, she joins me now. You know the people who have these two percent, three percent rates, they are not selling. So, they're not, you know, putting more of these existing homes on the market. What's the outlook for the housing market?. JEANNA SMIALEK, FEDERAL RESERVE AND ECONOMY REPORTER, NEW YORK TIMES: Yes, they're just bragging about those two to three percent rates at parties, right? Yes, you know, it's a really interesting moment for the housing market because if you are a new buyer in this market, you're just being clobbered from all sides. We've got mortgage rates at a 21-year high. We've got very little inventory because as you mentioned, people just aren't selling houses.  And we have seen, you know, actually some new construction coming online, but that hasn't been as robust as you might have expected in a world where we didn't have higher interest rates. You know, the higher interest rates also deter people from building houses. And so, tough time to buy a house. Affordability is really, really tough. Prices are high, even as these mortgage rates keep ratcheting up.","What factors have contributed to the current challenges in the housing market, including high mortgage rates and low inventory?","The challenges in the housing market, including high mortgage rates and low inventory, have been caused by several factors. As mentioned in the excerpt, mortgage rates have surged to their highest level in 21 years, making it more expensive for buyers to purchase a home. Additionally, there is very little inventory available as existing homeowners are not motivated to sell their homes with low interest rates. This lack of inventory, combined with limited new construction due to higher interest rates, has created a tough environment for new buyers. The result is decreased affordability, with high prices and increasing mortgage rates making it difficult for prospective buyers to enter the market.",b79cacce3296663ab2c13d9972f3c17b
9,"They studied five forests in Brazil, Puerto Rico, Panama, and Australia, ScienceAlert reported.  These three perspectives combined to give them an idea of when the leaves, which are harbingers of health for the rest of the tree, begin to malfunction.  Without change, we're headed toward disaster. . The nutrients a tree needs to sustain itself are created when it photosynthesizes. So if photosynthesis is interrupted, a plant will essentially starve to death. . Since plants take in carbon dioxide when they photosynthesize, they can help moderate the amount of greenhouse gases in the air.  But if a plant dies, all the carbon it's stored in its body gets released into the atmosphere. . Tropical forests make up about 12% of the Earth's land surface. So if this heat threshold is reached, that whole chunk of Earth's surface might begin to die off, releasing greenhouse gases into the air with it, said Christopher Doughty, a professor of ecoinformatics at Northern Arizona University. . If all the trees in the tropical rainforests died off, that would release an estimated 228.7 petagrams of carbon into the atmosphere, according to a 2012 study.  One petagram of carbon is equal to 1 Gigaton (or a billion metric tons), so 228 petagrams are equivalent to six times the amount of carbon emissions emitted worldwide in 2022, alone.  ""If that all went into the atmosphere, that would accelerate climate change,"" Doughty said. He was the one up in the trees, taping each sensor delicately to the tropical canopy.  Though the researchers found that .01% of the leaves in the tropical rainforest have reached their heat-induced limit, there is room for error in the measurements, Doughty cautioned.  They arrived at their measurements based on the data they were able to gather from key areas globally, but they weren't able to actually measure all the tropical leaf temperatures across the globe.  They estimated them by combining their ground data with satellite data, but there might be slight deviations from their estimation. .",What would be the environmental and climate change implications if all the trees in tropical rainforests were to die off?,"If all the trees in tropical rainforests were to die off, it would have significant environmental and climate change implications. According to a study referenced in the excerpt, the death of all tropical rainforest trees would release an estimated 228.7 petagrams of carbon into the atmosphere, which is equivalent to six times the amount of carbon emissions emitted worldwide in 2022. This would significantly accelerate climate change, as the additional carbon in the atmosphere would contribute to the greenhouse effect. Additionally, tropical forests play a key role in moderating the amount of greenhouse gases in the air by taking in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. The loss of these forests would result in the loss of this important carbon sink.",8392f8b43c24f080cdf97bfdd72a42a8

You know, it's interesting that these tensions have existed between South Korea and Japan since Japan colonized parts of Korea pre-World War II. So, this is a very long-held grudge when you think about the relationship that was forged between the United States and Japan after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, this grudge goes back a very long time between these two countries.  JOHN RATCLIFFE, FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Yes, you know, look, Martha, I think this is an opportunity for the Biden administration. I'm rooting for them. There hasn't been much in terms of foreign policy that I've had an opportunity or any of us have had an opportunity to say good things.

So, as you -- as was reported at the at the outset here, especially now, building relationships, alliances, partnerships with South Korea and Japan, you know, in the Indo-Pacific right now in the face of Chinese aggression is a really good thing and it's a good opportunity. Here's what worries me, Martha, here's what I don't like, is that in the lead up to this, the talk about this was, that this was not about China, even though it was a security summit and there was some even debate about whether they should mention China or how they should mention China and that they the country's needed to align their messaging on China. That's only a good thing if you have good messaging.

9,"Grid on knife edge as project delays risk blackouts, electricity market operator warns. A continuation of delays and disruptions to new energy projects will impose perilous risks of power outages as soon as the coming summer, amid escalating closures of ageing coal-fired power plants and unexpected blowouts to the deadline and cost of the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro scheme.  The independent energy grid operator said state and federal government schemes to encourage investment in preparing the grid for its transition to clean energy, coupled with private projects under development, should be enough to prevent blackouts if all goes to plan.  However, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) said in its annual report that delays to any projects ""have the potential to result in periods of high risk throughout the 10-year horizon"". The report is designed to send an investment signal to the energy market to spur new projects where needed.  This is an ominous warning targeted at state and federal governments, following frequent setbacks on a number of critical energy projects.  The electricity market's reliability standard requires at least 99.9994 per cent of forecast customer demand to be met each year. Under this test, Victoria and South Australia are forecast to breach the standard this summer, followed by NSW in 2025 when the Eraring coal plant is set to shut, and Queensland in 2029.  However, AEMO's forecast is based on a conservative threshold that considers only projects with fully committed funding. Chief executive Daniel Westerman stressed there are a plethora of proposed projects with a total generation potential that far outweighs that of the east coast grid's 65 gigawatt generation capacity.  ""While our central scenario shows increased reliability risk, it does not reflect the reliability potential from the 248-gigawatt pipeline of proposed generation and storage projects, actionable transmission projects and government energy programs under way,"" he said.  The Victorian and NSW governments are nervous about energy security and the risks of blackouts as the grid is weaned off fossil fuels, with coal plants closing at a rapid rate as cheaper renewables come on the market.",What are the potential risks of power outages due to delays and disruptions in new energy projects?,"The potential risks of power outages due to delays and disruptions in new energy projects are highlighted in the annual report by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).

The Belt and Road Initiative will enable China to achieve a higher level of opening-up and promote common development and prosperity of all Belt and Road countries, Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang said.  Ding was speaking at the eighth Belt and Road Summit which is being held on Wednesday and Thursday. Jointly organized by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government and Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the summit marked the 10th anniversary of the BRI which was unveiled by President Xi Jinping in 2013.  ""In the past 10 years, China has adhered to the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits that have achieved fruitful results in building the BRI,"" Ding said in a pre-recorded opening keynote speech.  The vice premier noted that China has signed more than 200 cooperation documents with 180 countries and international organizations for building the BRI collectively. It is estimated that more than 3,000 cooperation projects with an investment of $1 trillion is involved.  Ding also expressed his four expectations for Hong Kong, as the city should preserve its unique advantages so that it can assume more important functions in the joint construction of the BRI.  The four expectations are: Hong Kong should consolidate its status as an international financial, shipping, and trade center; deepen regional cooperation and expand its economic and trade network such as joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership; serve the diversified financing needs of the Belt and Road construction; and establish itself as a cultural melting-pot to facilitate people-to-people bonds.

Even more so as tensions spilled over into economic and security domains as witnessed in export control rows between Seoul and Tokyo as well as a rancorous spat over low-altitude flybys by Japanese maritime patrol aircraft over South Korean warships in 2018 and 2019.  But the Yoon administration's decision in March to resolve the issue of Japan's wartime forced labor has given rise to a thaw in the bilateral ties, while North Korea's growing nuclear and missile threats have underscored the urgency for the two neighbors to patch things up.  In the midst of an intensifying Sino-U.S. rivalry, Biden has been seen promoting rapprochement between Seoul and Tokyo, apparently harnessing his experience as vice president during the Barack Obama administration that helped foster a thaw between the neighbors as seen in a 2015 deal to address the issue of Japan's wartime sexual slavery.

Unruly telecom cables may seem an unlikely tourist attraction, but in the Vietnamese town of Hoi An you can buy t—shirts that celebrate the thick snarls and loops of wire dangling from many of the nation's telegraph poles. In Bangkok, similar messes are celebrated by tourists and locals alike, who snap selfies with the hanging wires. How did these messes come about? ""This is basically mismanaged,"" network and security professional Yasir Nawaz told The Reg when showed a picture of intersecting wires on poles containing many loops. ""Usually when ordering above ground cables you specify the size. It could be any fixed size. Once it is shipped, it is up to implementation to get it to look nice. In the photo, the cable is longer than required. With so many cables of incorrect length, it gets messy, and it makes it difficult to tell them apart,"" explained Nawaz. The networking pro said many technicians leave the wires on utility poles because the installation may not be permanent and tidying cable messes ahead of imminent replacement is considered an unnecessary effort. Extra cable also helps carriers because troubleshooting is easier when there's a bit of slack to work with. But after cabling is confirmed to work correctly, and to be in the right location, if no one is being paid to leave a tidy site, messes remain in place. But are these above ground mixes of telephone, broadband, cable TV, and electricity cables really problematic – or just an eyesore? ""Both,"" said Nawaz. ""Aerial cables face dangers associated with thunderstorms and things touching it."" In extreme cases a pole can even collapse under the load of excess cable. The tropical climate i many of Asia's most populous nations makes rot a real threat. ""The long run solution is to go underground. It's just safer,"" Nawaz said. In 2016, the city of Bangkok decided to do just that: move its power, cable and telecommunication lines underground.",Why do telecom cables often become tangled and messy above ground?,"Telecom cables often become tangled and messy above ground due to mismanagement during the installation process.

Most likely maintaining category-four strength once again by the time we get to Monday, and then significantly slow before it makes that hard right turn. And depending on how soon that happens will determine the impacts to the U.S. if any.  So right now good news is staying well north of the Caribbean Islands.

10,"Inevitably, unless something changes over the coming weeks from positive word-of-mouth, this $46 million-budgeted picture is destined for the box office pound. . Strays has, at least, joined some distinguished company. The Jennifer Lawrence sex comedy No Hard Feelings has, on paper, been a reasonable box office success, making $86 million worldwide on a budget of $45 million, but it has also been suggested that its actual production budget was as high as $70 million. . Its central conceit, of a 30-something woman being paid to take a shy young man's virginity, has also attracted criticism. As one anonymous studio executive told Vulture: ""I think this concept is terrible. When the first trailer came out people were like, What the f___? Really? She's going to sleep with some guy? It was so distasteful and weird that it just didn't seem like a great idea."". Others have simply flopped altogether. The much-hyped Joy Ride was expected to be the next Crazy Rich Asians, but despite decent reviews, it has stuttered to a mere $15 million so far. Next up is the unfortunately named teen sex comedy Bottoms; despite being produced by Elizabeth Banks, it might be that its status as a ""campy queer high school comedy in the vein of Wet Hot American Summer but more for a Gen-Z queer audience"", in the words of its writer-director Emma Seligman, will end up being too niche for mainstream audiences. . After all, if you can't laugh at a group of foul-mouthed dogs voiced by A-list celebrities, what chance does a comedy about unpopular high school students trying to seduce cheerleaders by setting up their own fight club really have? . The great screenwriter William Goldman's most-quoted maxim about Hollywood is ""nobody knows anything"". By and large, the late Goldman has been vindicated handsomely in this supposition. Yet for decades, there was one exception to this, and it was the certainty that low-budgeted, adult-oriented comedies would almost inevitably make a lot of money. .","What factors have contributed to the lack of success for the mentioned films, including ""No Hard Feelings"" and ""Joy Ride""?","The lack of success for the mentioned films, including ""No Hard Feelings"" and ""Joy Ride,"" can be attributed to various factors. For ""No Hard Feelings,"" its central conceit of a 30-something woman being paid to take a shy young man's virginity has attracted criticism and been deemed distasteful and weird by some. Additionally, the high production budget, rumored to be as high as $70 million, may have affected its profitability. As for ""Joy Ride,"" despite decent reviews, it has struggled at the box office, earning only $15 million so far. The specific reasons for its lack of success are not mentioned in the excerpt. However, it is worth noting that the film was expected to be the next ""Crazy Rich Asians,"" but it may not have resonated with mainstream audiences. These factors, along with potential niche appeal and the competitive nature of the film industry, can contribute to a lack of success in the box office.",78f6f427e5459f0b997669452f9123a8

10,"It serves as an important condition for friendly coexistence between states and provides a set of rules for normative behavior, as well as an effective means for resolving disputes and conflicts while promoting international cooperation for common development. The United States, relying on its military hegemony, has consistently refused to abide by the basic principles of international law and the basic norms governing international relations and has deliberately acted in opposition to them. The prohibition of the unlawful use of force or threat of force, a fundamental principle of international law, has been consistently ignored by the United States, a country that has repeatedly and brazenly launched wars against sovereign countries. The creation of an independent Space Force and the establishment of a Space Command have accelerated the testing of U.S. space weapons and military exercises, seriously contradicting the concept of the peaceful use of space. Moreover, scandals of systemic prisoner abuse at the Guantanamo Bay prison proved the U.S. military has trampled on the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. In September 2022, during the official negotiating conference of the State Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention held in Geneva, Switzerland, the Russian delegation made public a series of documents alleging that the United States had violated the Convention. One of the disclosed documents described a patent technology, named ""Toxic Mosquito Aerial Release System,"" which involves the use of drones to transport a large number of mosquitoes with toxins to specific areas. These mosquitoes are then released with the intention of infecting the targeted population with deadly diseases, achieving a ""low-cost dissemination of lethal diseases,"" and incapacitating the adversary. The document added that once ""legal restrictions are adjusted or removed,"" the technology could be used immediately for military purposes and become a more lethal ""tool"" than the most advanced weapons available. The Biological Weapons Convention was opened for signature in 1972 and entered into force in 1975, with 185 States Parties and four Signatory States now. It serves as the foundation of global governance for biological security.","What are some examples of how the United States has violated international law and norms, according to the excerpt?","According to the excerpt, the United States has violated international law and norms in several ways.

10,"US offers $12 billion to auto makers, suppliers for advanced vehicles. WASHINGTON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is offering $12 billion in grants and loans for auto makers and suppliers to retrofit their plants to produce electric and other advanced vehicles, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on Thursday.  ""While we transition to EVs, we want to ensure that workers can transition in place, that there is no worker, no community left behind,"" Granholm, a former governor of car-manufacturing state Michigan, told reporters in a call.  Speeding grants and other subsidies to fund conversion of existing auto plants to build electric vehicles could help the White House blunt criticism from automakers and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union over proposed environmental rules aimed to help usher in the EV era.  The UAW has warned that a rapid change could put thousands of jobs at risk in states such as Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana.  Last week UAW members voted overwhelmingly in favor of authorizing a strike at the Detroit Three automakers if an agreement over wages and pension plans is not reached before the current four-year contract expires on Sept. 14.  On Thursday UAW President Shawn Fain cheered the announcement, saying the policy ""makes clear to employers that the EV transition must include strong union partnerships with the high pay and safety standards that generations of UAW members have fought for and won."". President Joe Biden said in a release that ""building a clean energy economy can and should provide a win-win opportunity for auto companies and unionized workers who have anchored the American economy for decades."". Fain has vowed to save a Jeep factory in Belvidere, Illinois, that Stellantis (STLAM.MI) has put on track to shutter. The automaker has left open the possibility that the factory could get a new product with government aid.  When asked about the chances that the grants could keep that factory open, Granholm said plants that had been built up around communities are ""prime for taking advantage of these funding opportunities."". There will be no specific labor requirements for companies to obtain the funding, but projects that have better labor conditions will have a greater chance of receiving the funding, an Energy Department official said on the call.",How does the Biden administration's offer of grants and loans for auto makers and suppliers relate to the concerns of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union?,"The Biden administration's offer of grants and loans for auto makers and suppliers relates directly to the concerns of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.

10,"And Trump is already using his anticipated trip to Georgia as a political weapon, sending out a fundraising appeal on Sunday referencing a Washington Post report about a ""violent Atlanta jail with crumbling walls"" and accusing Democrats of adopting the totalitarian policies of Soviet and Chinese tyrants Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong. The email was consistent with Trump's use of inflammatory language to attack his political foes and to maintain the cash flow that is helping to pay his legal bills.  But his appeal also underscores one of the most head-spinning features of the campaign. A candidate who has a decent chance of being the 47th president is leveraging his unprecedented stack of criminal indictments, which could land him in prison if convicted, to seek political advantage. It's a tactic that appears to be working among GOP primary voters given his wide polling lead thus far. Whether a potential nominee who could spend much of next year on trial rather than on the campaign trail as a viable general election candidate is another question, however.  A fourth, sweeping indictment. Trump was charged in Fulton County last week under racketeering laws with being the kingpin of an alleged ""criminal enterprise"" involving 18 others to reverse President Joe Biden's win in Georgia, a swing state that will again be critical in 2024. Many of those co-defendants are expected to also turn themselves in over the coming days, in a spectacle that will underscore the huge scale of the case being brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, as well as the accounting taking place over a previous election with another campaign well underway.  Trump, the first-ever ex-president to be indicted, had already been charged in two federal probes – one into his election-stealing effort and the other into his mishandling of classified documents at his Florida resort after he left office. Trump, who denies all wrongdoing, is also awaiting trial in Manhattan in a case arising from a hush money payment to an adult film actress in 2016.  The crush of cases means next year is shaping up as an election year like no other as prosecutors and judges juggle trial dates in multiple prosecutions and Trump's swamped legal team seeks to put off any reckoning until after the November 2024 election.",What are the charges against Donald Trump and how are they impacting his political campaign for the 47th presidency?,"Donald Trump is facing multiple charges that could potentially land him in prison if convicted.

One of Las Vegas's most exciting food events is returning this year, with 30 of the city's most hyped chefs descending on the Arts District armed with open-fire grills, pizza ovens, and bold ideas. In the fourth year of the Vegas Unstripped food event, local chefs are taking to the street in front of Esther's Kitchen to remind locals that impressive culinary talent can be found Off-Strip.  UnStripped got its start in 2019, as a response to the behemoth Strip-powered event, UnCork'd. ""We got a letter that we were invited to participate in UnCork'd,"" says James Trees, the chef and owner for Esther's Kitchen. ""The letter said I had to make 5,000 portions of food and provide all the flatware, food, and labor. And they'd charge me $5,000 on top of that as a gift for being a part of it."" Trees ran the numbers with chef Bryan Howard of Sparrow + Wolf and decided that, for that degree of work and money, they could produce their own event.  So UnStripped was born with the help of Eric Gladstone's Feast of Friends marketing company. For the 2019 event, about 600 locals and tourists clamored around the 18 or so chefs who debuted new dishes that they developed just for the event. The 2020 sequel was canceled due to the pandemic and the 2021 event technically took place — but with challenging pandemic restrictions like limited attendance and mandatory proof of vaccinations.

10,"Approximately 100 car batteries can be produced from one ton of lithium. However, to extract and utilize this one ton of lithium, around 2-million-ton of water are required. Therefore, despite the environmentally friendly nature of battery-powered cars, they still involve excessive water consumption in the manufacturing process. In most cases, the value of used water is not taken into account. Even if it were considered, if it were quantified similarly to petroleum or any other resource, the true cost of battery production, including battery-powered cars, would be evident.  Nickel and cobalt are also of a similar nature. Due to their environmentally damaging effects, the Philippines has halted mining operations in 23 mines. Despite these concerns, batteries continue to be used and will be used in the future. However, each battery will eventually lose its functionality after a certain period of use. This means that old batteries must be discarded, much like toy cars. Currently, only five percent of discarded batteries have been recycled. What has happened to the rest? It can be assumed that they have been buried somewhere on the Earth's surface.  The meaning of all this is similar to the concept of weather and climate. The short-term benefits that electric cars provide, as shown by their usage, do not demonstrate the long-term consequences they bring. The popularity of electric cars is higher in countries with greater electricity production capacity, efficiency, and economic stability. Electricity production is a significant factor here. Even if thermal power is used, and its combustion produces emissions, it is still detrimental to the environment. When we consider examples of clean energy, we observe that the countries demonstrating them have relatively lower populations and are mostly imperialistic. If we take the example of India, 61% of its total electricity production comes from thermal power, and its primary source of fuel is coal. . In this regard, India's total carbon emissions result in 60% from energy production. We can also mention Bangladesh in this context, although we do not have statistics on the number of battery-operated vehicles in the country. However, the majority of Bangladesh's electricity production depends on thermal power.","What are some environmental concerns associated with the production and disposal of batteries, specifically for battery-powered cars?","Some environmental concerns associated with the production and disposal of batteries, specifically for battery-powered cars, include excessive water consumption during lithium extraction and utilization.

10,"Moore went on to lose the election to Democrat Doug Jones after a sizable number of Republicans deserted him in a deeply red state.  Graham and his colleagues believed that they could elicit more accurate answers about Trump by asking respondents to assess their view of him—and their likelihood of voting for him—as if they did not know he had been indicted. To test their theory, they commissioned a SurveyMonkey poll of more than 5,000 Americans in which half were asked questions in this counterfactual format: ""Suppose you did not know about the indictment. How would you have answered the following question: How likely are you to vote for Donald Trump?"" They asked the other half questions that pollsters more commonly use.  The experiment produced significantly different results. Like other surveys, the poll based on the traditional format found that the indictments increased Trump's support among Republican primary voters. But the poll based on the counterfactual framing found that the indictments slightly hurt his standing in the party, reducing by 1.6 percent the likelihood that Republicans would vote for him.  The real-world implications of the researchers' findings are, well, limited—at least for now. Trump's polling lead in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire averages more than 25 points; the gap widens to nearly 40 points in recent national surveys. A drop of 1.6 percent suggests that charging Trump with multiple felonies is akin to tossing a pebble at a fast-moving train. ""I don't know that I make much of it at all,"" Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist who regularly conducts focus groups of voters, told me.  In Longwell's experience, the response from Trump supporters to the indictments has been consistent for months: ""They say they do not care about them."" Views about the former president have been locked in place for years, Longwell said, and most Trump supporters give either a neutral response to the indictments or say that the charges make them even more likely to vote for him. Almost no one, she told me, said the indictments make them less supportive.","How did a counterfactual framing in a poll affect Republicans' likelihood of voting for Donald Trump in light of his indictment, and what impact did the indictment have on his overall support among Republican voters?","The counterfactual framing in the poll, where respondents were asked to assess their likelihood of voting for Donald Trump as if they did not know about his indictment, found that the indictments slightly hurt his standing among Republican voters. The poll showed a reduction of 1.6 percent in the likelihood that Republicans would vote for him. However, in the overall context, this decrease is minimal. Trump still maintains a significant lead in early voting states and national surveys, with a polling lead of over 25 points in Iowa and New Hampshire and nearly 40 points in recent national surveys. The impact of the indictments on his overall support among Republican voters seems to be limited, as many Trump supporters have consistently expressed that they do not care about the indictments or are even more likely to support him in light of the charges. This indicates that the views about the former president and his support base have remained unchanged for years, despite the legal challenges he faces.",411d8fc8369fa4832ff4f207637d750e
10,"And much to the surprise of many pundits, that was a successful strategy.  Joe Biden did a lot better and Democrats a lot better in the midterm elections than everyone thought they would.  So when Donald Trump, if he's a Republican nominee, is facing Joe Biden directly, when he's back in the public eye, if Americans see him in a courtroom and trial, as could be the case in one of the issues in Georgia, I think that question and the potential threat of a potential autocratic Trump second term could be a big issue.  Right now, it is not so much. It could work. But American elections are still decided by about four or five states; in each state by about 20,000 votes. It doesn't take much change in electoral conditions, economic conditions to change that picture.  SOARES: I do wonder whether the framing then of the race raises as you point out, questions about America's democracy or the threat to democracy. I ask this because today really in a historic first, a group of 13 presidential foundations and centers joined together to issue a statement calling for civility and respect in political discourse.  [14:35:00]. SOARES: I'll read this out.  In the statement they write, ""Americans have a strong interest in supporting democratic movements and respect for human rights around the world because free societies elsewhere contribute to our own security and prosperity here at home."". This is what the group said.  ""But that interest is undermined when others see our own house in disarray. The world will not wait for us to address our problems so we must both continue to strive toward a more perfect union and help those abroad looking for U.S. leadership."". Which then goes to my other question that we are being asked, fellow Republicans, candidates, why are they backing Donald Trump or not seeing this as an opportunity?. COLLINSON: The reason is because look at that CNN poll: 34 percent of Republicans think Joe Biden got enough votes to be president.",Why are fellow Republicans and candidates backing Donald Trump or not seeing this as an opportunity?,"Fellow Republicans and candidates are backing Donald Trump or not seeing this as an opportunity because there is still a significant portion of Republicans who believe that Joe Biden did not receive enough votes to be president.

10,"Biden Must Explain to the American People Why We're Supporting Ukraine—Before It's Too Late | Opinion. As the war in eastern and southern Ukraine rages on, President Biden has pursued practical, measured, and strategic policies in support of Ukraine against Russia's war of aggression. Yet he has failed at an important task: conveying to the American people the rationale for their participation in this conflict, namely, their common national purpose with Ukraine.  What the Biden administration has failed to explain is that the ongoing war is not just a territorial dispute, as some would have it. Instead, it represents the first concerted attempt by great and rising powers to overturn the current world order since World War II. Allowing Moscow to annex Ukrainian lands with impunity, with Beijing and Tehran subsidizing Putin's efforts to consolidate his gains, will set in motion a change of events that will wither away the current order that seeks to uphold human rights, civic freedoms, and laws and norms regarding the use of force.  This is certainly not the first war the U.S. has been involved since 1945 as a non-combatant. As part of a United Nations effort to repel North Korean and Chinese forces from South Korea, the Truman administration provided significant military assistance, supplies, and eventually troops as the U.S. sought to prevent the armed spread of communist ideals. As part of the Truman Doctrine, President Eisenhower sent some 700 military personnel as well as considerable military and economic aid to the government of South Vietnam to assist in the fight against communist guerilla forces. During the bloody eight-year long Iran-Iraq war, the Reagen administration provided Saddam Hussein with invaluable intelligence regarding the location of Iranian troops. More recently, the Obama administration provided varying degrees of support to anti-government rebels and Kurdish forces that valiantly fought the Assad regime and ISIS.

To do this, we must decisively move to a new economic model, which is led not by abstract achievements, but by a real improvement in the lives of citizens."". The Kazakh leader acknowledged several significant achievements in the past few years, including the doubling of salaries for teachers since 2020, significant salary increases for doctors, and the implementation of initiatives like the ""National Fund for Children,"" and the construction of over 300 healthcare facilities in rural areas.  Turning his attention to current economic objectives, Tokayev set forth a course based on principles of fairness, inclusiveness, and pragmatism. He said, ""The most important task is the formation of a solid industrial framework of the country, ensuring economic self-sufficiency. The main emphasis should be placed on the accelerated development of the manufacturing sector."". Particular focus will be given to sectors like heavy engineering, uranium enrichment, and automotive components, he noted.","What is the main focus of Kazakhstan's economic reforms, as outlined by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev?","The main focus of Kazakhstan's economic reforms, as outlined by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, is to establish Kazakhstan as a major transit hub in Eurasia, with a focus on key routes such as the Trans-Caspian and the International North-South Corridor.

10,"Giuliani joins Ken Chesebro, a former Trump attorney, as well as a former campaign attorney, Ray Smith, who surrendered earlier today.  Both are accused in this indictment and charged in this indictment. Chesebro, for his role in the fake electors scheme; Smith, prosecutors allege, was in the room when fake electors met in Atlanta in December of 2020.  He, too, according to prosecutors, spread election conspiracy theories and election lies. There's a number of people who have already turned themselves in. They range from people like bail bondsman, Scott Hall, who was part of the process of illegal accessing of voting data in rural Coffee County as well as the former GOP chairman here of the state of Georgia, David Shafer, who was instrumental in that fake electors scheme.  It really underscores how sprawling of an investigation this was for Fani Willis and how difficult it has been to coordinate the logistics of 19 defendants turning themselves in -- Becky.  ANDERSON: And they have to turn themselves in by Friday, of course. Let's just focus, again, briefly on Rudy Giuliani. He will resonate, I'm sure, with many of our viewers around the world, who will remember him as the, you know, the mayor to everyone, the mayor of America on 9/11.  Of course, he was the New York mayor at the time. This is quite something spectacular, a fall from grace, as it were. I know these are only allegations at the moment.  [10:35:00]. ANDERSON: But the very notion of seeing him in Fulton County courthouse today to have his mug shot taken and his prints taken, if indeed that's what's going to happen, is quite remarkable.

10,"How BRICS Became a Real Club and Why Others Are Joining. The BRICS group of emerging market nations — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — has gone from a slogan dreamed up at an investment bank two decades ago to a real-world club that controls a multilateral lender. Now it is expanding its ranks, inviting Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Argentina and Ethiopia to join in 2024. The enlargement will pair some of the world's largest energy producers with the developing world's biggest consumers, potentially enhancing its economic clout. The expansion also gives the bloc, which is likely to be renamed BRICS+, more scope to challenge the dollar's dominance in oil and gas trading by switching to other currencies. . 1. How did BRICS get started? . ""BRIC"" was coined in 2001 by economist Jim O'Neill, then at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., to draw attention to strong growth rates in Brazil, Russia, India and China. It was intended as an optimistic thesis for investors amid market pessimism following the terrorist attacks in the US on Sept. 11 that year. The four nations took the idea and ran with it. Their rapid growth at the time meant they had shared interests and common challenges. They were already cooperating in forums like the World Trade Organization and felt their influence in a US-dominated world order would be greater if their voices were combined. The first meeting of BRIC foreign ministers was organized by Russia on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in 2006. The group held its first leaders' summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join at the end of 2010, extending membership to another continent and adding another letter to the original acronym. The latest expansion was agreed to in August at a summit in Johannesburg. .  . 2. What does BRICS do?. The biggest concrete achievements have been financial. The countries agreed to pool $100 billion of foreign currency, which they can lend to each other during emergencies. That liquidity facility became operational in 2016.","What was the original purpose and formation of the BRICS group, and what are some of their financial achievements?","The original purpose of the BRICS group, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, was to draw attention to the strong economic growth rates in these countries. The acronym ""BRIC"" was coined in 2001 by economist Jim O'Neill to highlight their shared interests and challenges. The BRICS countries believed that by combining their voices, they could have a greater influence in a world order dominated by the United States. The group has since expanded to include South Africa. As for financial achievements, the BRICS countries agreed to pool $100 billion of foreign currency, creating a liquidity facility that became operational in 2016. This facility allows member countries to lend to each other during emergencies, enhancing financial cooperation among the group.",845551f3a2c544f5822c769b6cca433f
10,"""He has a firm handshake... He reminds me of my grandfather."". The White House has been keen to get Biden out on the campaign trail again, amid a sense that his stewardship of America's economic recovery is not registering in the polls.  For his speech at Prince George's Community College in Largo, given against a backdrop of American flags and ""Bidenomics"" signs, Biden introduced a new line of attack: MAGAnomics.  The idea is to portray all Republicans as followers of former president Donald Trump -- known for his ""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA) slogan -- and highlight Trump's economic failures.  Biden also sought to blame them for the threat of a looming government shutdown at the end of this month.  But was the message getting through here, to the audience of around 200 local people and college students in a dormitory town half an hour's drive from the White House, let alone to millions of voters?. ""I think this was a good tip of the iceberg,"" said Porter, a local chapter treasurer of Student Veterans of America. ""But I'm going to need more concrete follow up."". Porter said she had asked Biden about housing in particular ""and he nodded and said we have a whole plan."". Biden still had work to do to convince the electorate, agreed Don Pruett, 68, director of planning at the college.  The president's speech is ""going to plant the seeds and over the course of time it needs to be nurtured,"" he said. ""We need to see the fruits."". Susanna Anderson, the blue T-shirt wearer, however said Biden was ""getting the message through to the people who need to hear"" -- including her sister, whom she said had just had her student loans forgiven by the Biden administration, a policy opposed by Republicans.  Biden hammered that message home repeatedly, slamming the lectern at one point as he reeled off what he said were Republican plans to cut spending.  He also lashed out at the record of Trump -- who faces a string of criminal charges including over election interference, and whom he will likely face in a rematch in 2024 -- and warning darkly that ""democracy's under attack."".",What is Biden's new line of attack against Republicans and how is he attempting to highlight Trump's economic failures?,"Biden's new line of attack against Republicans is called ""MAGAnomics,"" which aims to portray all Republicans as followers of former President Donald Trump and highlight Trump's economic failures.

10,"""This enduring, harmful … narrative is now colliding with the current wave of anti-Asian xenophobia and bigotry — creating a dangerous environment in which Asian Americans are extraordinarily vulnerable to warrantless government surveillance and profiling,"" Kusakawa added.  Civil rights representatives have previously cited legal complaints about the intelligence community's domestic misuse of the authority. Meanwhile, intelligence and national security officials argue the tool is vital to U.S. operations and that information sourced from Section 702 makes up a large chunk of President Biden's daily briefings.  A White House advisory board in July recommended new restrictions be placed on 702, but argued against a long-demanded ask that authorities seek a warrant before probing certain electronic communications. Meanwhile, key members of Congress say they will not support reauthorization unless significant revisions are agreed upon. Civil liberties groups recently met with National Intelligence Director Avril Haines and other intelligence officials, urging them to commit to a range of related reforms to the contentious spying power that is set to expire at year's end unless it is reauthorized by Congress. . MGM and Caesars hacked by same group. Hospitality giants MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment were both breached by the same hacking group just a few weeks apart, Bloomberg News's William Turton, Christopher Palmeri, and Katrina Manson report, citing four people familiar with the matter. . They write: ""The hackers demanded a ransom from MGM, according to two of the people. It wasn't immediately clear how much ransom was requested or if the hackers deployed ransomware to lock up the company's files."" Separately, Caesars paid tens of millions of dollars to the group that held company data for ransom, according to a separate Bloomberg report that cited two people familiar with the matter.  They write: ""MGM was still working to resolve the turmoil caused by the hackers, known as Scattered Spider, four days into the cyberattack that has disrupted the company's websites, reservation system and some slot machines at its casinos across the country, according to two of the people.""

His speech was instead delivered by China's commerce minister. There's been no official explanation for his absence at that event. David McKenzie back with us this hour from Johannesburg.  [11:35:00]. We have seen him, though, alongside the other leaders of three nations plus, of course, the foreign minister of Russia. That is because Vladimir Putin hasn't traveled to South Africa.

Now, I think this indicates that possibly a roadmap has been decided on how to expand this BRICS grouping beyond.

And so, allowing the public to watch this in real time, allowing newsrooms to have access to video so they can do fact checks, so they can dispel falsehoods. I think that's important. It's going to help clean the public discourse.  Because there's going to be a lot of inflame tensions around watching the former President Trump on trial. Let's hope that misinformation and that sort of thing can be kept in check. And if video plays a role in that, which I think it will, I think that's important.

I don't think he's -- this is going to be in his benefit. I know that there's some -- there's some people who think that maybe the high drama would be helpful for him. But I think it's going to be difficult because he's going to be in a court of law where he's forced under oath to tell the truth and where he's not running the show, a judge is running the show. It's a judge's courtroom. And so, he's going to be bound by rules. He's going to be forced to tell the truth.

And we can talk about all of these things, and there's a lot of crazy, woke things happening in schools, but we have got to get these kids reading. If a child can't read by third grade, they're four times less likely to graduate high school.  So we need to make sure we bring in reading remediation all over this country.

10,"On a musical level, I don't expect people to be such nerds they have articulate opinions about the overuse and abuse of the I–V–vi–IV progression, but suffice to say that if you think that in the last 20 years all pop music has started to sound the same, there's a very good reason for that. And Taylor Swift is one of the worst offenders, in the sense that she's not just going to the well until it runs dry lyrically, she's also essentially writing the same songs over and over again.  Again, maybe casual listeners aren't to be expected to pick up on this, but to a remotely trained ear, bad pop songwriting is like pornography: You know it the moment you hear it. The Beatles catalog is comparatively devoid of songs consisting of these same trite and overused chord progressions, and if you think of individual chords and melodies as a proxy for evoking different emotions, Taylor Swift's music occupies a very, very specific range in terms of the breadth of the human condition she is speaking to. Granted, it's perhaps the broadest, most appealing (and shallowest) tranche, so that's something. . To drag this back to the Beatles, think about ""Eleanor Rigby."" It's incredibly sophisticated. There are counter melodies, staccato strings, and it's notable for its repeated use of ""plagal cadences"" where the IV chord resolves to the I, or root chord in the key. Musically, this particular songwriting move is most closely identified with hymnody — it's also known as the ""Amen Cadence"" — a remarkable move for a song about church life, and one McCartney probably did instinctually.  . Which brings us to the lyrics. McCartney is putting himself in the shoes of others and trying to empathize with their loneliness: ""Eleanor Rigby/Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been/Lives in a dream/Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door/Who is it for?""",What is the author's main criticism of Taylor Swift's music in terms of its songwriting?,"The author's main criticism of Taylor Swift's music in terms of its songwriting is that it is repetitive and lacks originality. The author argues that Swift relies on overused chord progressions, specifically the I-V-vi-IV progression, and that her songs are essentially the same with minimal variation. The author contrasts Swift's music with the Beatles, highlighting the complexity and sophistication of their songwriting in comparison. The author also suggests that Swift's music appeals to a broad but shallow range of emotions, lacking the depth and nuance found in other compositions.",311dfd6f2df5e24c5c0fd384bee270ee

10,"To generate the necessary political will to commit to a just green transition, countries need a vision of energy abundance, rich biodiversity, and a thriving planet. To this end, as members of the UN Secretary-General's High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism (HLAB), we propose that a Pact for the Future, which has been proposed as the outcome of the Summit of the Future, include the set of recommendations to rebalance the relationship between people and planet outlined in the report that HLAB submitted to the UN Secretary-General in April. Our proposals recognise that a healthy planet is a global public good that benefits all of humanity. It would align existing treaty commitments, raise collective ambition, and marshal the resources to enable states and non-state actors to build a net-zero future. For developing countries, the green transition offers a chance to join the ranks of the world's high-income countries. While they lack the financial means to fund ambitious policies like the US Inflation Reduction Act and the European Green Deal, many of these countries have abundant natural resources, such as forests that must be safeguarded to preserve the planet and the critical minerals and rare earths required to achieve the energy transition. Moreover, global power shifts have given them additional leverage to pursue new funding options and fairer agreements to address climate challenges. As active participants in the negotiations for a Pact for the Future, low- and middle-income countries can increase their green ambitions, take a lead in creating a sustainable future, and push back against the old ""international division of labour,"" in which their natural resources were exploited to create wealth and accelerate decarbonisation in advanced economies. Instead, at the upcoming Summit of the Future, they can propose and negotiate multilateral agreements and financing mechanisms to deliver a just climate transition alongside the Sustainable Development Goals.

The first step is to reaffirm existing treaty obligations - including the Paris climate agreement, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, and others - and to accelerate progress with time-bound targets.",What is the purpose of the proposed Pact for the Future and how does it aim to address the relationship between people and the planet?,"The purpose of the proposed Pact for the Future is to rebalance the relationship between people and the planet and to generate the necessary political will for a just green transition.

Authorities in an isolated ethnic Armenian region of Azerbaijan have allowed entry of a humanitarian aid shipment in a step toward easing a dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan that had blocked transport to the region since late last year. YEREVAN, Armenia -- Authorities in an isolated ethnic Armenian region of Azerbaijan on Tuesday allowed entry of a humanitarian aid shipment in a step toward easing a dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan that has blocked transport to the region since late last year.  The region, called Nagorno-Karabakh, has been under the control of ethnic Armenians since the 1994 end of a separatist war. That war had left much of the surrounding territory under Armenian control as well, but Azerbaijan regained that territory in a six-week-long war with Armenia in 2020; Nagorno-Karabakh itself remained outside Azerbaijani control.  Under the armistice that ended the war, Russia deployed some 3,000 peacekeeping troops in Nagorno-Karabakh and were to ensure that the sole road connecting the enclave to Armenia would remain open. However, Azerbaijan began blocking the road in December, alleging Armenians were using it to ship weapons and smuggle minerals.  The blockage caused serious food shortages in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan proposed that food be sent in on a road leading from the town of Agdam, but the region's authorities resisted the proposal because of concern that it was a strategy to absorb Nagorno-Karabakh.  Azerbaijan agreed this week that both the Agdam road and the road to Armenia, called the Lachin Corridor, could be used for aid shipments under International Committee of the Red Cross auspices.  The aid delivered on Tuesday includes 1,000 food sets including flour, pasta and stewed meat, along with bed linen and soap.  ""We regard the fact that the cargo was delivered precisely along the ... road as a positive step and an important shift towards the opening of this road,"" said Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Aykhan Hajizade.",What caused the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan that blocked transport to the Nagorno-Karabakh region?,"The dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan that blocked transport to the Nagorno-Karabakh region was caused by Azerbaijan's allegation that Armenians were using the sole road connecting the enclave to Armenia to ship weapons and smuggle minerals.

10,"""For every study that finds a particular approach works, another one comes out that's against it."". Getting to the bottom of diet science won't be easy. Part of the problem is that research on food is terrifically challenging. To do it right requires tracking what people eat over long periods of time, which is expensive, and keeping them on diet plans that they may not like, which is as easy as herding cats. Because health problems tend to emerge over many years from complex causes, it's difficult to trace them directly to diet alone, never mind particular foods or individual ingredients.  That's why so many theories abound that may not have a sound scientific basis. What's needed more than new theories are practical solutions grounded in the relatively small universe of unimpeachable facts about how to eat healthfully. That's true in the realm of public policy, where a movement is afoot to protect children from the ravages of the food industry. In July, for instance, the WHO called for countries around the world to implement regulations with a particular eye to protecting children from junk-food marketing.  Kerdkanno/Getty. It's also true in the myriad decisions individuals have to make when shopping, cooking and deciding what to have for lunch or feed the kids. Although much of the dietary advice currently circulating in the zeitgeist is questionable, Newsweek has sifted through the myriad competing and confounding claims and separated what is factual about healthful eating from what is merely speculative. What's left are a few bedrock principles to keep in mind.  Do Calories Really Matter?. Making the diets of Americans healthier has long been primarily about reducing the rate of obesity. And for good reason, notes Howard Sachs, a physician and associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School. ""When I see a patient who's overweight, I have to consider whether this person is at risk of cardiac disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis and sleep apnea,"" he says.  For more than half a century doctors and public-health experts have been pushing out the message that recommending changes in diet is the best way of tackling the problem of excess weight. (Research strongly links exercise to better health but not in any clear way to weight loss.)","What is the focus of the dietary advice currently circulating in the zeitgeist, according to Newsweek?","The dietary advice currently circulating in the zeitgeist, according to Newsweek, is primarily focused on reducing the rate of obesity and improving overall health. This is because obesity is linked to various health problems such as cardiac disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, and sleep apnea.

Athens, Greece — More than 800 people have been rescued over the past two days from floods in Greece, the fire department said Thursday, after severe rainstorms turned streets into raging torrents, hurling cars into the sea and washing away roads. The rainstorms have also hit neighboring Bulgaria and Turkey, leaving 14 people dead in the three countries, including three people in Greece.  Fire department spokesperson Vasilis Vathrakogiannis said swift water rescue specialists and divers from the department's disaster response units, as well as the army, were participating in rescue efforts and were trying to reach remote areas despite roads having been washed away.  The flooding follows on the heels of devastating wildfires that destroyed vast tracts of forest and farmland, burned homes and left more than 20 people dead.  The flooding on Thursday was concentrated mainly in the central towns of Karditsa, where people were reportedly seeking safety from rising water levels on the roofs of their homes. More rain was forecast for later in the day.  In some areas, floodwaters were higher than 6 feet, Vathrakogiannis said. Tracked vehicles and boats were being used to help evacuate people, but the boats were unable to reach some areas due to the large volume of debris and the strength of the torrents of floodwaters. Frequent lightning meant helicopters were unable to fly, he added.  More than 2 years' rain in 12 hours. Government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis said some areas received more than twice the average annual rainfall of Athens in the space of 12 hours.  Defense Minister Nikos Dendias cut short a trip to Dubai and was returning to Greece ""to oversee the greatest contribution of the Armed Forces in dealing with the consequences of the severe weather,"" he announced on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.  Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis postponed his annual state of the economy speech and a news conference scheduled for the weekend in the northern city of Thessaloniki in order to visit the flooded areas.",What caused the flooding in Greece and neighboring countries?,"The flooding in Greece and neighboring countries was caused by severe rainstorms that led to streets turning into raging torrents, washing away roads and hurling cars into the sea.

10,"Climate scientists, and private companies, are therefore beginning to deploy machine learning to speed things up. Pangu-Weather, an AI built by Huawei, a Chinese company, can make predictions about weather a week in advance thousands of times faster and cheaper than the current standard, without any meaningful dip in accuracy. FourCastNet, a model built by Nvidia, an American chipmaker, can generate such forecasts in less than two seconds, and is the first AI model to accurately predict rain at a high resolution, which is important for predicting natural disasters such as flash floods. Both these AI models are trained to predict the weather by learning from observational data, or the outputs of supercomputer simulations. And they are just the start—Nvidia has already announced plans to build a digital twin of Earth, called ""Earth-2"", a computer model that the company hopes will be able to predict climate change at a more regional level, several decades in advance.  Physicists trying to harness the power of nuclear fusion, meanwhile, have been using AI to control complex bits of kit. One approach to the research involves creating a plasma (a superheated, electrically charged gas) of hydrogen atoms inside a doughnut-shaped vessel called a tokamak. When hot enough, around 100m°C, particles inside the plasma start to fuse and release energy. If the plasma touches the walls of the tokamak, though, it will cool down and stop working, so physicists contain the gas within a magnetic cage. Finding the right configuration of magnetic fields, however, is fiendishly difficult (""a bit like trying to hold a lump of jelly with knitting wool"", according to one physicist).  Managing the configuration of magnetic fields manually requires coming up with mathematical equations to predict what the plasma will do and then making thousands of small adjustments every second to around ten different magnetic coils. By contrast, an AI control system built by scientists at Google DeepMind and EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, allowed scientists to try out different shapes for the plasma in a computer simulation—and the AI then worked out how best to get there.  Automating and speeding up physical experiments and laboratory work is another area of interest.",What are some examples of AI being used in climate science and nuclear fusion research?,"In climate science, AI is being used to enhance weather prediction.

And then also, sort of land management could have avoided the fact that when you have a desert environment, when there is a heavy rainfall, it just -- it's not absorbed into the soil, the water just rushes down into the Wadi, the valley, in this case, and therefore those dams broke because they simply -- there was too much water for them to handle, sending, as we heard from another UN official, a seven-meter-high wall of water rushing through Derna, which according to Libyan Military officials, washed entire neighborhoods and their residents away.  Now, we don't know the death toll at this point. The numbers being put out are all over the place, but it's obviously thousands, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, probably more.  [11:05:00]. In addition, there are still as many as 10,000 people unaccounted for. So, it's hard to say -- it's easy to say, actually, after a disaster what could have been done differently.

Even a summer as extreme as this one is unlikely to significantly shift this dynamic, Swain said, even though it is likely to be followed by a string of years that are even hotter and more chaotic due to the onward upward march of global temperatures. Greenhouse gas emissions still remain historically high and the impact of El Niño is likely to be even more keenly felt next year.

The president's constitutional power to ""grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States"" doesn't apply to convictions on state crimes, such as the charges Trump faces in New York and Georgia. As for federal crimes, legal scholars are split about whether the president can self-pardon.

Others argue that the plain meaning of ""grant"" (to give to someone else), and ""pardon"" (to forgive or excuse) suggest it's not a power Trump could use on himself.

The Office of the Prime Minister has announced the rollout of the comprehensive drought relief programme, providing food assistance and livestock support to affected subsistence farmers across all 14 regions.  The programme is in response to the findings of the Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis Report for 2023–2024, which reveal alarming findings.  According to the report, Namibia has been grappling with below-normal and sporadic rainfall, resulting in flash floods and dry spells that severely impact crop yields and livestock.  ""Namibia experienced below-normal and sporadic rainfalls, which culminated in a combination of flash floods and dry spells in some parts of the country. This has subjected communities to prospects of lower crop yields, impacts on livestock, and ultimately reduced household food stocks, compromising food security at household levels,"" said I-Ben Nashandi, Executive Director in the Office of the Prime Minister.  The report indicated that poor rainfall distribution has led to abnormally dry conditions, especially in the northern part of the country, leading to poor crop performance.  As a result, all crop-growing regions, including Omusati, Oshana, Ohangwena, Oshikoto, Kavango East, Kavango West, and Zambezi, have experienced a significant decline in harvests.

10,"But agricultural land isn't an easy sector for retail investors to get exposure to. Large agricultural assets are typically owned by wealthy farming families who have built up their holdings over generations, by institutions and pension funds, and by very wealthy individuals, such as Gina Rinehart, who is said to control 9.2 million hectares or 1.2 per cent of Australia's entire landmass.  The best avenue for retail investors is via unlisted funds focused on farmland. Many of these funds tend to be quite opaque, and unlike equities funds, they don't publish annual return data.  The top Australian agricultural property funds are currently producing total returns in the high single digits to low teens, made up of a dividend paid monthly and capital growth. Most will accommodate retail investors with $500,000 to contribute, although that differs from fund to fund.  The goFARM fund is a value-added agricultural fund which aims to improve farmland and operations to deliver higher total returns, which have been running at about 20 per cent in recent years.  The fund is chaired by Robert Costa of the Costa Group and describes itself as a high conviction investment manager, which prefers to make big bets on a limited number of key opportunities.  It is currently raising cash from high net worth and ultra-high net worth individuals to pursue more opportunities.  Another option for retail investors to consider is the Argyle Group, which is focused on horticulture.

The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has begun installing life-size cut-outs of grey langurs on roads along the Central Ridge in an attempt to keep rhesus macaques, colloquially known as rhesus monkeys, away from transit routes and venues during the G20 Summit. The civic body will also deploy 40 trained workers who will mimic the sound made by grey langurs in an attempt to keep monkeys away from hotels and G20 Summit-related venues, senior officials aware of the matter said.  NDMC vice chairman Satish Upadhyay said that these temporary steps are being taken in coordination with the Delhi forest department to ensure that monkeys remain inside the Ridge and do not cause disruptions to the motorcades of dignitaries.  ""The langur cut-outs have been put up on an experimental basis, and we will have to see how much actual impact they have on the monkey density. We also have trained people who are experts in making sounds similar to langurs. They will be deployed at various sites across New Delhi to keep monkeys in check,"" Upadhyay said.  However, experts expressed their doubt over whether these methods will be successful, and called for a more extensive study to tackle Delhi's monkey problem.  Delhi has never carried out any monkey census, but their unchecked population growth has led to monkey attacks being a regular feature in various parts of the city.  One of the most high-profile monkey attacks occurred in 2007, when deputy mayor SS Bajwa was attacked by monkeys, fell off the terrace of his house, and died of head injuries. Shortly afterwards, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) began catching and relocating monkeys to the Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary following orders from the Delhi high court.  Over the last 16 years, more than 21,000 monkeys have been relocated to Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary, an MCD official said.

Brookfield is looking to grow its $25-billion asset portfolio in the country further, said former central banker Mark Carney, also the UN Special Envoy for climate action and finance. The chair of Brookfield Asset Management and head of transition investing at the firm told Deepshikha Sikarwar & Vinay Pandey in an interview that India has a big opportunity amid global supply chain disruptions. Edited excerpts:The US Federal Reserve chairman has made it clear the central bank is not done with containing inflation. What is your reading of Jerome Powell's statement?. My reading of what he emphasised is that the Fed's policy is going to continue to be restrictive for some time. It's clearly restricted now and is going to need to continue to be restricted. He emphasised rightly that they're going to look at the totality of the data in making their decisions.  Strong Rationale for Supply Chain Being in India  (Powell) wasn't making a pre-announcement of the decision, nor should he, but he's clearly signalling as is appropriate. The policy needs to continue to be restricted for a period of time in order for them to meet their mandate.What does it mean for the financial markets and emerging economies such as India?Whether it's an emerging economy, one of the most important economies in the world, India, or the US' neighbour, Canada - what we both need is price stability in the US. We need the Fed to do its job and the Fed is doing its job.How fast is the global supply chain disruption happening and does India have an opportunity there?The short answer is yes. And then the second part of the answer is that we expect to see a lot more. I distinguish between marginal decisions. I've got a new investment and where should I make it? Do I make it in Vietnam, China or India?

10,"Abated gas is an evolving transition fuel for decarbonisation. Opinion. Carbon capture and storage or offsets have to be a priority to reduce emissions and secure the global energy mix.  Kevin GallagherContributor. When the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) released its 2023 Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO) last month, it highlighted an increasing risk of rolling blackouts this summer with warnings that failure to replace ageing coal plants with new capacity, combined with potential shortages of coal and gas, had raised the risk of outages across the grid.  Australia is rich in resources and there is no excuse for energy shortages. There is a simple fix. Just like housing, the answer is more investment to bring more supply to the market.  Yet decades of moratoriums, glacial approvals processes and interventionist energy and climate policy has contributed to an electricity grid fraught with vulnerabilities and a corporate sector less willing to invest in a highly regulated market where supply and demand signals can no longer be relied upon.  Open, competitive markets always deliver the best outcomes for consumers and the confidence that producers need to take measured investment risks.  Fossil fuels still account for more than 90 per cent of Australia's primary energy mix today. Gas accounts for about one-quarter of this. If we are serious about emissions reduction, abating fossil fuel emissions has to be part of the decarbonisation solution.  We need gas for electricity generation, for manufacturing, for agriculture and many other everyday products.  Australian farmers feed the nation and are important food producers for other countries through agricultural exports. Ammonia-based fertilisers produced from gas are a critical input. When gas prices go up, fertiliser prices go up and in turn so do food prices. And if farmers use less fertiliser to reduce their costs, crop yields go down, not only resulting in higher prices but also food shortages.  The same types of flow-on effects from gas scarcity apply to housing. When gas prices go up, brick, cement and steel prices go up and in turn so does the cost of constructing new houses.  The economy-wide impact of gas shortages should not be underestimated.",Why is abating fossil fuel emissions important for decarbonisation and the overall economy?,"Abating fossil fuel emissions is important for decarbonisation because fossil fuels, such as gas, account for a significant portion of Australia's primary energy mix. To reduce emissions and combat climate change, it is crucial to transition to cleaner energy sources. Additionally, fossil fuels have a wide range of applications in various sectors including electricity generation, manufacturing, agriculture, and everyday products. By reducing fossil fuel emissions, we can mitigate the negative impacts on food prices, crop yields, construction costs, and overall economic stability, as mentioned in the excerpt. This transition requires more investment in increasing the supply of clean energy sources and fostering open, competitive markets to ensure the best outcomes for consumers and encourage investment in a highly regulated market.",48e6563c375e46536251ca6101ddfdcf

Today is Sunday, August 20th, 2023.  10 days ago, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, revised its hurricane forecast to above normal due to record warm temperatures at sea surfaces. Roughly 40% of the world's oceans are experiencing marine heat waves, the most since satellite tracking started in 1991. This temperature shift is especially notable in the Gulf States - Florida, Louisiana, and Texas - hitting record highs this July. This is worrisome on multiple fronts, the health of those ecosystems, the hurricane season, and the impact of El Niño. What's causing these marine heat waves, and should we be worried? Here to help us dig into it, I'm now joined by Dr. Kapnick, Chief Scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Dr. Kapnick, thanks for joining me.  Dr. Sarah Kapnick:.

These heat waves are particularly notable in the Gulf States, such as Florida, Louisiana, and Texas, where temperatures have reached record highs. This is concerning for multiple reasons. Firstly, it poses a threat to the health of oceanic ecosystems. Warmer waters can lead to the bleaching of coral reefs and harm marine life.

10,"UK private investment 'needs to rise by two-thirds to reach net zero by 2050'. Researchers have forecast how different scenarios for reaching net zero will benefit or negatively impact the economy in the long term.  Private investment needs to increase by two-thirds for the UK to reach net zero by 2050, researchers have said.  The Government must provide the right incentives to attract investors to create ""a virtuous circle that stimulates further innovation and technological advancements"", according to a report released by trade association Energy UK in partnership with Oxford Economics on Friday.  In the Path to Prosperity paper, researchers forecast how different scenarios for reaching net zero could benefit or negatively impact the economy in the long-term.  They found that the most ambitious scenario – referred to as Net Zero Transformation – will deliver the greatest benefits in terms of boosting the economy.  They said the UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) could be 6.4% or £240 billion higher by 2050 compared to the baseline scenario, which reflects the current state of play.  The researchers also found that under the current policies the UK is unlikely to achieve its climate goals.  But they said that bolstering investment could lead to lower costs and increased productivity, giving the example of how costs in solar and offshore wind have fallen in recent years in the UK.  The Net Zero Transformation scenario would also see private investment boosted by £165 billion and 226,000 extra jobs created as sectors such as manufacturing, construction, automotive and the supply chain, electricity generation, transmission and distribution all grow their gross added value to the UK's GDP, the report said.  However, the report warns that delaying action until the 2030s would lead to much lower private sector investment in the long run as well as a fall in economic output and employment compared with the baseline scenario.  The paper comes as the latest in a series, which has so far highlighted the need for the UK to incentivise investment in clean energy in the face of growing global competition.  The Biden administration in the US passed the Inflation Reduction Act last year, which offers government subsidies to support clean energy technologies, green jobs and infrastructure.  The move prompted the European Union to respond with its own Green Deal Industrial Plan.",What is the impact of private investment on reaching the net-zero goal in the UK by 2050?,"Private investment plays a crucial role in reaching the net-zero goal in the UK by 2050.

10,"We are the first federal government to have a cabinet minister for cybersecurity. Our work has been driven through two main tracks.  First, in the past year we've implemented 10 significant reforms that were obvious and urgent – including building a cyber incident response function in the Australian government and constructing Hack the Hackers, a collaboration between the Australian Signals Directorate and the Australian Federal Police.  We've applied special cyber protections to the most important pieces of Australian infrastructure, and reformed the Privacy Act to encourage protection of citizen data.  While this has been going on, we've been hard at work on our second track: building a new National Cyber Security Strategy for Australia.  What I have heard loud and clear is that to defeat the cyber challenge, government needs to be at the table as a partner and a leader, using every lever of national power to help keep our citizens and businesses safe.  Over the last year, our citizens and businesses have told us they feel vulnerable and alone in tackling the challenge. Our government's strategy will seek to change that. Our goal is to build a backbone to support the actions and commitments of everyone involved – every citizen, business and organisation – so that when we act to improve cybersecurity, the whole country benefits.  In short: co-ordinated national action to make the whole more protective than the sum of the parts.  Our strategy is to build six Cyber Shields around Australia, each designed to layer strong protections around our businesses, organisations and citizens.  The first shield is strong citizens and business: a small-business community and a citizenry that understand the power they have to protect themselves, and can recover better from cyber events.  Our second shield is safe technology. Just as you cannot buy an unsafe car from a car yard, by 2030, we want digital products to be safe for use before they hit the shelves.  Our third shield is world class threat sharing and blocking. By 2030, we see a world where threat intelligence can be exchanged in real-time, at machine speed – and, where possible, threats blocked before they cause significant harm.  Our fourth cyber shield will help build reliable services, protecting critical infrastructure, such as water, energy and healthcare, that Australians rely on.  Our fifth cyber shield is sovereign capabilities.",What are the six Cyber Shields that Australia aims to build as part of its National Cyber Security Strategy?,"Australia aims to build six Cyber Shields as part of its National Cyber Security Strategy.

However, another Russian outlet, RBC, which is a business outlet, is citing sources saying that he is set to take up another post within the Ministry of Defense after a, quote, ""short holiday"". So look, there are a lot of questions still out there. The fact remains that we have not seen actual evidence of him, photos, videos, anything, since there was a video, a message by him around the time of that mutiny telling Prigozhin to pull back his forces. So we still have a lot of questions around this, but a significant development.",What is the significance of the dismissal of the head of Russia's aerospace forces in relation to the war in Ukraine and Putin's grip on power?,"The dismissal of the head of Russia's aerospace forces is significant because it raises questions about Putin's grip on power and the ongoing war in Ukraine. The article suggests that the dismissal could add weight to the argument that the head of the aerospace forces may have been complicit in the aborted Wagner mutiny, indicating a potential reshuffling or purging of top ranks within the Russian military. However, there is still a lack of evidence and many unanswered questions surrounding this development.",fb3551452bca4d2b3040c71fc7189259

10,"Different role preventing other strikes. The Biden administration played very different roles in the earlier negotiations at UPS, the ports and the railroads.  At UPS, it followed the Teamsters union's desire that it stay out of negotiations, and a tentative deal was reached a week before a strike deadline which was later overwhelmingly approved by union membership.  At the ports, acting Labor Secretary Julie Su helped mediate the talks after being invited in by both sides. There, the two sides had both continued to work for months under terms of an expired contract without there being a strike.  At the freight railroads, which operate under a separate labor law from most other private sector workers, Biden and Congress imposed a contract on workers to keep them on the job despite the fact that most had voted against it. The president was criticized by unions for that action.  Biden and Democrats in Congress supported a second bill that would have met a key union demand - sick days for members - but despite majority support in both chambers, it failed to get the 60 votes it needed to pass the Senate. However, since then, most of the railroads have reached agreements with most of the unions to grant the workers the sick day provisions they wanted.         .
